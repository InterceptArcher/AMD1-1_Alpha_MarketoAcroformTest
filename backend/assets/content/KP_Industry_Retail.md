## Decoding the Retail Tech Buyer: Global Priorities and Regional Nuances (2023 -2025)

## I. Executive Summary: Navigating the Evolving Retail Technology Landscape

The global retail sector is undergoing a profound transformation, with technology at its epicenter. Between 2023 and 2025, B2B technology buying decisions are being shaped by the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI), the non - negotiable demand for omnichannel excellence, and the escalating influence of sustainability imperatives. Retailers are prioritizing investments in AI, advanced data analytics, cloud infrastructure, and supply chain modernization to navigate a rapidly changing consumer and economic environment. 1 While these global trends are pervasive, significant regional variations in buyer behavior, the pace of technology adoption, and the stringency of regulatory pressures across North America, EMEA, and APAC necessitate carefully tailored engagement strategi es from technology providers. The convergence of AI, omnichannel strategies, and sustainability initiatives is fostering a complex buying environment where solutions are expected to be interconnected, addressing multiple strategic priorities simultaneously . Retailers are no longer merely purchasing an "AI tool"; they seek AI -powered omnichannel personalization engines that can also track and report on sustainability metrics, for example. This shift is driven by the pursuit of a "holistic, frictionless, and personalized experience" for the end consumer and the relentless need for operational efficiency. 1 Consequently, B2B technology providers must evolve their offerings and messaging to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the retailer's ecosystem, showcasing how their solutions contribute to these interconnected strategic goals, favoring platform - based solutions or those with strong, demonstrable integration capabilities. 3

## II. The Global Retail B2B Technology Buyer: A Shifting Paradigm

## A. Evolving Buyer Personas and Decision - Making Units (DMUs)

The decision-making process for technology procurement within the retail industry is witnessing a significant evolution, characterized by increased complexity and the involvement of a wider array of stakeholders extending beyond traditional IT departments.  Business leaders, including Heads of Merchandising, Marketing, Operations, and Supply Chain, are exerting considerably more influence on technology choices. 5 This shift is a direct consequence of technology's escalating and measurable impact on their specific key performance indicators (KPIs). The role of Chief Data &amp; Analytics Officers (CDAOs) has become particularly pivotal, especially for investments related to data analytics, AI, and customer insights. CDAOs are tasked with transforming data into a strategic asset and ensuring robust data governance, making their input crucial for data-centric technology acquisitions. 6

While Chief Information Officers (CIOs) continue to oversee IT infrastructure and systems, their function is adapting to that of a more strategic business partner. This evolution necessitates a closer alignment of IT initiatives with overarching business objectives, ensuring that technology investments directly support the company's strategic goals. 5 According to Gartner, 91% of retail IT leaders are prioritizing AI as the top technology for implementation by 20 26, underscoring the strategic importance of IT le adership in driving innovation. 5

The amplified involvement of CDAOs and business unit leaders signifies a fundamental change in how technology purchasing decisions are made. These decisions are now less reliant on technical specifications alone and more heavily weighted towards demonstrable business value, return on investment (ROI), and strategic alignment. While technical feasibility remains a foundational requirement, the ability of a solution to deliver tangible business outcomes-such as increased revenue, reduced operational costs, or enhanced customer retention-is the primary differentiating factor for B2B technology providers.

Furthermore, the CDAO's pronounced focus on data governance and strategy  6 means that any technology solution handling data, particularly AI and analytics platforms, will undergo intense scrutiny. This examination will cover data quality, security protocols, privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR, CPRA), and integration capabilities. Given that data breaches or non-compliance can result in severe financial and reputational damage, CDAOs will naturally prioritize technologies that not only offer advanced analytical capabilities but also adhere to stringent data governance principles and simplify the path to compliance.

## B. Key Drivers of Technology Investment in Retail

Several powerful forces are compelling retail B2B buyers to invest in new technologies, reshaping their operational and strategic priorities.

- ● Evolving Consumer Behavior: The contemporary consumer is more demanding than ever, seeking exceptional value, hyper -personalized interactions, seamless omnichannel experiences, and, increasingly, products and practices that align with sustainability and ethical standards. 2 This sophisticated consumer

expectation is a primary catalyst for technology adoption. For instance, a Deloitte survey found that 71% of retail executives anticipate consumers will increasingly use generative AI for their shopping activities, compelling retailers to integrate such capabilities. 1 This shift from "mass to micro" requires a data-driven, hyperpersonalized experience for individual consumers. 8

- ● Operational Efficiency and Cost Optimization: The retail market is characterized by intense competition, rising operational costs (exacerbated by factors like climate change and price wars), and persistent labor challenges. 1 In this environment, retailers are aggressively prioritizing technologies that automate processes, reduce overhead, and improve profit margins. 8 McKinsey forecasts that the implementation of AI and automation technologies could reduce operational costs by as much as 30% within the grocery sub - sector, highlighting the significant efficiency gains sought. 12
- ● Competitive Differentiation and New Revenue Streams: Technology is increasingly viewed as a critical enabler for creating unique and memorable customer experiences, which is vital for differentiation. Furthermore, retailers are leveraging technology to develop innovative business models, such as retail media networks (RMNs), and to effectively target emerging consumer segments like Generation Alpha. 11 The projected growth of retail media ad spending, expected to surpass all other digital channels by 2025, underscores the strategic importance of these new revenue -generating capabilities. 9

The drive towards "efficient mass to micro" personalization 1 presents a core challenge for retailers: delivering highly individualized experiences at scale without a proportional escalation in costs. This tension is a significant impetus for investments in AI and automation. Manually achieving micro -personalization  for millions of customers or relying on outdated legacy systems is both prohibitively expensive and too slow for the current market pace. Therefore, technologies like AI, which can automate personalization, analyze vast customer datasets, and optimize pro cesses at scale, are transitioning from being advantageous add - ons to essential operational components.

Another notable development is the emergence of retailers as "media giants" 13 , achieved by monetizing their rich first - party data and digital platforms. This trend not only creates a new category of B2B buyer -the retailer as a sophisticated procurer of advertising and data technologies -but also intensifies competitive pressures for smaller retailers who lack the resources to develop such capabilities independently. This necessitates distinct technology strategies for different tiers of retailers.

## C. The B2B Buying Journey in Retail Technology

The path B2B retail technology buyers take from identifying a need to making a purchase is increasingly complex and digitally mediated.

- ● Information Sources &amp; Channel Preferences: Buyers typically engage with multiple (between three and ten) digitally driven channels during their research phase. 14 They place significant trust in credible, third - party sources, particularly analyst reports from firms like Gartner (Magic Quadrants), Forrester (Waves), and IDC (MarketScapes), for vendor evaluation and comprehensive market understanding. 15 Peer networks, along with customer success stories and detailed case studies, also exert considerable influence on decision - making. 16 Content marketing plays a pivotal role; on average, buyers consume around 13 pieces of content before arriving at a purchase decision. Educational content, such as blog posts, white papers, and webinars, is crucial for building trust and effectively nurtu ring leads, especially during the early to middle stages of the buying funnel. 17
- ● Sales Cycle Length and Stages: The average sales cycle for technology solutions is approximately 90 days. 19 However, this duration can fluctuate significantly based on factors such as the complexity of the deal, the size of the prospective client company, and the specific type of solution being considered. For the retail sector specifically, one source suggests an average cycle from initial contact to closing of around 28 days (10 days for initial contact, 18 days for closing). 19 This relatively short timeframe likely pertains to simpler transactions or specific retail segments rather than complex enterprise technology deployments. More intricate B2B sales cycles typically involve distinct stages: lead generation, initial connecti on and outreach, lead qualification, product presentation or demonstration, addressing objections, deal closure, and post - sale customer nurturing. 20 Prospect companies of larger size generally experience longer sales cycles; for example, enterprises with over 10,000 employees may see 40 days for initial contact and an additional 45 days for closing. 19 Notably, inbound marketing channels, such as SEO and content marketing, tend to result in shorter sales cycles compared to outbound methods. 19

The retail tech buyer's journey is characterized by a significant degree of self -direction. Buyers conduct extensive research using digital content and seek third -party validation before  initiating direct engagement with a vendor's sales team. This autonomy elevates the importance of maintaining a robust online presence, delivering compelling and informative content marketing, and cultivating positive relationships with industry analysts. By the time a buyer makes direct contact, they are often already well-informed and may have a shortlist of potential solutions.

While some data points suggest shorter sales cycles for "retail"  19 , it is more probable that complex B2B technology sales within the retail sector, especially to large enterprises, align with the longer, multi-stakeholder sales cycles typical of the broader technology industry. 19  The 28-day figure may be skewed by simpler retail products or services, not comprehensive enterprise software solutions which involve intricate integrations and multiple decision-makers.

## III. Core Technology Priorities for Retail B2B Buyers (2023 - 2025)

Retail B2B buyers are strategically channeling investments into several key technology areas to address pressing challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

## A. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)

Artificial Intelligence, particularly Generative AI (GenAI) and the emerging field of Agentic AI, stands as a transformative priority for retailers. The industry is rapidly moving beyond initial experimentation to actively scaling AI use cases that deliver tangible business benefits. 3 Seven in ten retail executives expect to have AI capabilities in place within the year to help personalize experiences 1 , and nearly 80% of retailers have already adopted AI in some form. 2 IDC predicts that 95% of retailers will test and invest in GenAI by 2027 to enhance product data, customer support, and overall customer experience. 21

Key applications include:

- ● Personalization &amp; Customer Experience (CX): AI is fundamental to delivering the hyper -personalized experiences modern consumers expect. This includes AI -powered recommendation engines, tailored shopping journeys, intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants for customer service, and AI - generated pro duct descriptions to improve relevance and searchability. 2 Retailers using GenAI tools like chatbots during peak shopping periods, such as Black Friday, have noted a 15% better conversion rate. 1
- ● Operations &amp; Efficiency: AI and ML algorithms are being deployed to optimize a wide range of operational processes. These include demand forecasting, inventory management (e.g., Amazon using GenAI to help sellers create videos and Nykaa automating product listing reviews 3 ), supply chain optimization,

dynamic pricing strategies, store layout optimization, fraud detection, and the automation of repetitive administrative tasks. 2  Gartner predicts that by 20 28, Agentic AI will autonomously make 15% of day-to-day work decisions, a significant increase from zero percent in 20 24. 3

- ● Marketing &amp; Content: GenAI is being utilized for creating engaging marketing content, manipulating product imagery for better visual appeal, and assisting in product ideation and design. 3

The swift adoption and diverse applications of AI are cultivating an "AI expectation" among consumers. This, in turn, exerts pressure on retailers -and consequently, their B2B technology buyers -to implement AI capabilities rapidly to maintain competitivenes s. AI is transitioning from a differentiator for market leaders to a baseline capability for all. The emergence of "Agentic AI" 3 , designed to autonomously carry out tasks and make decisions, signals a future where AI systems assume more independent roles in retail operations, such as automated product reorders or dynamic pricing adjustments. This progression brings profound implica tions for trust, operational control, and the skill sets required of the retail workforce.

## B. Omnichannel and Unified Commerce Platforms

Achieving a seamless, consistent, and personalized customer experience across all touchpoints -including online platforms, mobile applications, physical stores, and social media channels-remains a paramount priority for retailers. 1 This necessitates the deep integration of data and processes to provide a unified, 360 - degree view of the customer and real -time visibility into inventory across the entire network. Forrester highlights a critical gap: while consumer demand for seamless o mnichannel experiences is high, only 21% of B2C leaders identify improving these experiences as a top priority, indicating a significant opportunity for B2B technology providers to offer solutions. 27 Forrester's research also identifies omnichannel fulfillment and omnichannel pricing and promotions as "Hot" investment priorities for 2024. 28

The pursuit of "composable commerce" reflects a strategic shift towards greater flexibility and agility in constructing and adapting omnichannel experiences, moving away from rigid, monolithic platforms. 26 Gartner estimates that nearly 60% of enterprise -level retailers will have adopted a composable commerce approach by 2025, leveraging modular, flexible IT systems to remain agile and responsive to market changes. 26  This architectural approach allows retailers to select and integrate best-of-breed components via APIs, offering superior adaptability to evolving customer expectations and new channel opportunities. The observed disparity between strong consumer demand for omnichannel capabilities and retailers' current prioritization or execution levels  27 underscores a substantial market need that B2B technology providers are well-positioned to address with effective and more easily implementable solutions.

## C. Data Analytics, Cloud, and Cybersecurity

These three pillars form the foundational technology stack for modern retail operations.

- ● Data Analytics &amp; Business Intelligence (BI): Advanced analytics are indispensable for understanding intricate customer behaviors, enabling deep personalization, optimizing inventory levels to reduce waste and stockouts, making data-driven pricing decisions, and accurately forecasting market trends. The emphasis is increasingly on real-time analytical capabilities and predictive modeling to anticipate future demands and customer needs. 2

2

- ● Cloud Computing: Cloud platforms are essential for providing the scalability, flexibility, and computational power required to support AI initiatives, big data analytics, and broader digital transformation efforts. A significant trend is the move towards distributed cloud models, with Gartner indicating that 89% of companies are expected to adopt this approach by 2025. 26 North America currently leads in overall cloud adoption. 29 Global end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723 billion in 2025, with SaaS accounting for around $300 billion of that. 29
- ● Cybersecurity &amp; Compliance: The importance of robust cybersecurity measures is escalating due to the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks, coupled with the enforcement of stringent data privacy regulations such as GDPR in Europe and CPRA in California. In 2023, 6 8% of companies increased their investment in cybersecurity. 26 Retailers face the critical task of protecting sensitive customer data and maintaining consumer trust, especially as concerns about AI and data privacy are cited as significant hurdles to technology adoption. 1 Third-party risk management has emerged as a top compliance priority for 2025, with 82% of compliance leaders having faced consequences due to third -party risks in the past year. 31

Data Analytics, Cloud, and Cybersecurity are not isolated priorities but are deeply interconnected, forming the bedrock of contemporary retail. Advanced analytics and AI necessitate robust cloud infrastructure for processing and storage. Simultaneously, both generate and handle vast quantities of sensitive data that demand stringent cybersecurity measures and adherence to compliance mandates. Consequently, investment decisions in AI or advanced analytics inherently require careful consideration of the underlying cloud strategy and associated cybersecurity protocols. The heightened focus on "third-party risk management"  31  means that retailers will scrutinize their technology vendors' security and compliance postures more rigorously than ever before.

## D. Supply Chain Modernization and Resilience

In response to recent global disruptions and ongoing volatility, retailers are making significant investments in technologies designed to enhance supply chain visibility, predictability, efficiency, and overall resilience. Key areas of investment include A I for more accurate demand forecasting and intelligent inventory management, warehouse automation leveraging robotics, real - time inventory tracking systems across all channels, and the adoption of digital twin technology for modeling, simulating, and optim izing complex supply networks. 1 Blue Yonder, for example, emphasizes AI's critical role in creating resilient supply chains and highlights the emerging importance of digital twins for proactive disruption management. 25 Bain suggests that custom AI forecasting models can cut excess inventory by 40% and boost accuracy by nearly 50% compared to manual planning. 10

The pronounced emphasis on supply chain resilience 10 is a direct consequence of the vulnerabilities exposed by recent global events, including the pandemic and geopolitical instability. 9 This has led to a strategic shift where B2B buyers are seeking solutions that not only optimize for cost but also prioritize agility, risk mitigation, and business continuity. The focus is moving beyond purely lean, just - in- time models towards more robust  and adaptable supply chain strategies.

## E. Sustainability and Ethical Commerce Technologies

Driven by a confluence of growing consumer demand for environmentally and socially responsible products 2 and increasing regulatory pressure globally 11 , retailers are actively investing in technologies that support and enable sustainability initiatives. These investments span a range of solutions, including technologies for enhancing supply chain transparency (such as blockchain), implementing sustainabl e inventory management practices (e.g., using AI to minimize waste and optimize stock 2 ), facilitating resale marketplaces and circular economy models, and utilizing tools for accurately measuring and reporting environmental impact, such as Digital Product Passports (DPPs). 2  Vaayu highlights the role of DPPs in meeting compliance for

## regulations like the EU ESPR and France's Loi AGEC. 34

Sustainability is rapidly transitioning from a niche concern or a peripheral marketing tactic to a core operational imperative and a significant compliance requirement. This shift is particularly pronounced in regions like EMEA, largely due to the implementation of comprehensive regulations such as the EU's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). 25  This regulatory landscape makes technology investments in sustainability less discretionary and more of a fundamental business need.

## F. Emerging Technologies on the Radar

While the aforementioned areas represent core investment priorities, several emerging technologies are also capturing the attention of retail B2B buyers, with practical applications beginning to gain traction:

- ● Immersive Experiences (AR/VR): Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are being increasingly utilized to enhance the online shopping experience. Applications include virtual try - ons for apparel and accessories, and tools that allow consumers to visualize how products like furn iture would look in their own homes. 21  The retail AR application market is projected to reach $57 billion by 2030. 37
- ● Internet of Things (IoT): IoT devices are being deployed for various in -store and operational enhancements, such as smart shelving that monitors stock levels, automated checkout systems, intelligent energy management, and the collection of data for in -store analytics to optimize l ayouts and traffic flow. 21
- ● Composable Architectures/Commerce: As mentioned earlier, there is a growing adoption of composable approaches to build and adapt retail systems with greater agility and flexibility. 26
- ● Mobile Commerce &amp; Advanced Payments: Mobile continues to be a dominant channel for retail transactions, driving ongoing investment in mobile - optimized experiences. The adoption of digital wallets and contactless payment methods also continues to grow. 26 In Europe, SoftPOS (Software Point of Sale), which allows merchants to accept payments directly on commercial off - the- shelf devices like smartphones, is an emerging trend. 38
- ● Digital Identity: Solutions related to digital identity are gaining importance, particularly in Europe, as secure and seamless customer identification becomes crucial for personalized experiences and fraud prevention. 38

While some futuristic technologies like the broad concept of "the metaverse" 26 may still be more hype than widespread reality for the majority of retailers, practical applications of AR/VR (such as virtual try-on to reduce returns), IoT (for operational efficiency through smart shelves), and composable commerce are gaining significant traction. This adoption is driven by their ability to address specific, tangible business problems or unlock clear, near-term opportunities.

## IV. Messaging and Content Expectations of Retail B2B Buyers

To effectively engage retail B2B technology buyers, vendors must align their messaging and content strategies with the buyers' evolving expectations and decision-making processes.

## A. Crafting Compelling Value Propositions

Messaging directed at retail B2B buyers must clearly and concisely articulate how the proposed technology solves specific, pressing retail challenges and delivers measurable, quantifiable ROI. 18  Buyers are primarily focused on achieving tangible outcomes such as efficiency gains, significant cost reductions, demonstrable revenue growth, and enhanced customer experiences. 8 Given that a substantial 80% of retail executives identify increasing price wars as a major operational hurdle 1 , technology solutions that offer competitive pricing structures or provide clear and substantial cost benefits will resonate strongly. Amid economic uncertainty, quality and overall value for money have become top priorities for consumers, a sentiment tha t invariably influences retailers' own procurement decisions. 33 B2B buyers are demanding greater value while often operating with fewer resources. 39

The prevailing emphasis on "value" 13 , particularly in a climate of economic uncertainty and intense price competition 1 , indicates that B2B technology buyers in the retail sector are likely to be more risk -averse. They will demand stronger, more convincing proof of ROI before committing to significant capital investments. This heightened scrutiny necessitates a value propo sition that is not only compelling but also rigorously substantiated.

## B. Preferred Content Formats and Channels

B2B retail technology buyers are sophisticated consumers of information, utilizing a diverse array of content formats across multiple channels throughout their decision -making journey. Educational content is paramount. Formats such as in - depth blog posts, authoritative white papers, compelling case studies showcasing real - world success, interactive webinars, engaging videos (especially product demonstrations and tutorials), informative podcasts, and visually accessible infographics have proven to be highly effective in capturing buyer attention and building credibility. 17

Industry analyst reports from respected firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC are highly trusted and frequently consulted for vendor evaluation, market insights, and understanding technology trends. 15  Content must be carefully tailored to align with the specific stage of the buyer's journey-whether it's initial awareness, deeper consideration, or the final decision-making phase. 18  The observation that the "average B2B buyer consumes 13 pieces of content" before making a purchase decision  18 highlights the critical need for a comprehensive and persistent content marketing strategy. This strategy should aim to nurture leads effectively through what can often be a lengthy and multi-faceted consideration phase.

## C. Building Trust and Credibility

In the current environment, establishing and maintaining trust is fundamental to successful B2B engagement in the retail technology space. Transparency is crucial, particularly concerning the use of customer data, the ethical implications of AI (promoting  "responsible AI"), and the robustness of security measures. 1 Buyers expect candidness about AI capabilities, including its limitations, and are wary of overhyped claims. 25  According to Accenture, 77% of European CXOs approach GenAI investments with caution due to societal concerns about the responsible use of AI. 40

Demonstrating a profound understanding of the retail industry's unique challenges, operational nuances, and strategic opportunities is essential for building credibility. 1 Authentic customer stories, detailed testimonials, and verifiable case studies serve as powerful endorsements and proof points. 16 The prevalent caution surrounding GenAI 40 and a general "strained consumer trust due to next - gen tech" noted by Deloitte 1 directly translate to B2B buyers being skeptical of "AI washing" or exaggerated technological promises. Retailers themselves are concerned about societal perceptions of AI and the potential for consumer distrust, which naturally extends to the technologie s they choose to procure. They will be keen to avoid adopting solutions that could tarnish their brand reputation or erode customer confidence.

## VI. Strategic Recommendations for Engaging Retail B2B

## Technology Buyers

Based on the analysis of buyer behavior, technology priorities, and messaging expectations within the global retail sector for 2023 - 2025, technology providers should consider the following strategic recommendations to enhance their engagement and success:

- 1. Develop Persona - Specific Engagement Strategies: Recognize that the B2B buying committee in retail is diverse. Tailor messaging, content, and sales approaches based on whether the primary contact is a CIO (focused on infrastructure, security, and strategic alignment 5 ), a CDAO (focused on data strategy, governance, analytics, and business value from data 6 ), or a line- ofbusiness leader (e.g., Head of Marketing, focused on customer acquisition and CX; Head of Supply Chain, focused on efficiency and resilience). Each persona has distinct pain points, priorities, and metrics of success.
- 2. Emphasize Integrated Solutions and Ecosystem Thinking: Retailers are increasingly seeking holistic solutions to complex, interconnected challenges. Move beyond promoting siloed point solutions. Instead, showcase how technologies -particularly AI, data analytics, cloud services, and omnichannel platforms -work synergistically to solve broader business problems and contribute to the retailer's overall strategic objectives. Highlighting strong integration capabilities and platform - based approaches will resonate with the need for efficiency and a unified view of ope rations and customers.
- 3. Lead with Value and ROI, Substantiated by Proof: In the current economic climate, characterized by price sensitivity and cost pressures 1 , B2B buyers are more risk-averse and demand strong justification for technology investments. Clearly articulate the tangible business outcomes your solutions deliver, such as operational efficiencies, cost reductions, revenue growth, or improvements in customer experience metrics. Back these claims with robust evidence, including detailed case studies, customer testimonials, and ROI calculators or frameworks. 17
- 4. Build Trust Through Unwavering Transparency: Address concerns about data privacy, AI ethics, and cybersecurity proactively and transparently. 1 Be candid about the capabilities and limitations of AI solutions, focusing on practical applications and responsible development. 25 Clearly communicate data handling policies, security certifications, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CPRA). This is particularly crucial for solutions that process sensitive customer or business data.
- 5. Customize Offerings and Messaging by Region: Acknowledge and adapt to the distinct priorities, regulatory environments, and consumer behavior patterns prevalent in North America, EMEA, and APAC (as detailed in Section V). For instance, emphasize robust compliance features and sustainability solution s when targeting EMEA; highlight advanced social commerce integration and

mobile - first capabilities for APAC; and focus on cutting-edge AI applications and comprehensive RMN solutions for North America.

- 6. Invest Strategically in Educational Content and Analyst Relations: Since B2B retail tech buyers conduct extensive self - directed research 14 , a strong digital presence and a wealth of high -quality educational content are essential. Develop content (blogs, whitepapers, webinars, case studies) tailored to each stage of the buyer journey, addressing their pain points and informational needs. Simultaneously, cultivate strong relationships with key industry analysts (e.g., Gartner, Forrester, IDC) to ensure positive visibility and favorable positioning in their influential reports and recommendations. 15
- 7. Prepare for the Next Evolution of AI: Look beyond current AI applications and anticipate the growing influence of more autonomous systems like Agentic AI. 3 Focus on developing solutions that are not only powerful but also trustworthy, explainable, and designed to augment human capabilities rather than simply replace them. Emphasize robust governance, control mechanisms, and ethical considerations in the desi gn and deployment of advanced AI.

## VII. Future Outlook: The Next Wave of Retail Technology (Beyond 2025)

Looking beyond the immediate 2025 horizon, several interconnected trends are poised to further reshape the retail technology landscape, presenting both challenges and opportunities for B2B providers.

The maturation of  Agentic AI , as predicted by Gartner to make 15% of day -to-day work decisions autonomously by 2028 3 , suggests a significant shift towards more autonomous retail operations. This will necessitate even greater emphasis on AI governance, explainability, and trust, as AI systems take on more direct control over processes like inventory management, pricing,  and even customer interactions. The "talent perception gap," where C - suite leaders may underestimate the critical role of skilled human capital in leveraging advanced technologies 40 , could become a more acute issue. If businesses do not adequately invest in upskilling their workforce or attracting specialized AI talent, the full potential of these sophisticated systems may go unrealized. This creates an opening for technology provide rs who can offer solutions with intuitive interfaces, embedded AI assistance for users, or comprehensive training and support programs to bridge these skill gaps. 46

Sustainability will likely become even more deeply embedded into every facet of retail technology, moving from a reporting requirement to a fundamental design principle. Continuous pressure from consumers and an increasingly stringent global regulatory environment will drive demand for solutions that enable circular economy models, provide granular carbon footprint tracking across the value chain, and optimize resource utilization through "eco-AI" approaches. 36

Retail Media Networks (RMNs) are expected to evolve into more sophisticated advertising and data monetization platforms. 13 This will fuel demand for advanced ad tech, data analytics, and customer data platform (CDP) capabilities among larger retailers. For smaller retailers, there will be a corresponding need for accessible, perhaps collaborative, solutions that allow them to compete in this data -driven advertising space.

While widespread adoption of  Web3 and metaverse technologies in retail has been slower than initially hyped 26 , the period beyond 2025 may see more practical and scalable applications emerge as the underlying technologies mature and clear use cases with demonstrable ROI are identified. Initial experiments in immersive commerce could evolve into more integrated and valuable customer experiences.

The complexities surrounding  data sovereignty and cross - border data flows will continue to grow, influencing technology architecture, cloud deployment strategies (favoring distributed or hybrid models), and compliance demands. Retailers operating internationally will require solutions that can navigate these intricate regulator y landscapes effectively.

Finally, the overarching theme of  digital transformation will persist, with Forrester noting that GenAI, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity will reshape industries at an unprecedented pace over the next five years. 4 For B2B technology providers, this means a continuous cycle of innovation, adaptation, and a relentless focus on delivering solutions that empower retailers to thrive in an increasingly digital, intelligent, and interconnected world.
