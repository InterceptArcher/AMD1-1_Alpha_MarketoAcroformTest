## Navigating the Enterprise Technology Landscape: Buyer

## Behavior and Strategic Imperatives (2023 - 2025)

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of B2B technology buyer behavior within enterprise organizations, focusing on how company structure, decision dynamics, buying patterns, and messaging expectations shape technology acquisition. The insights are  drawn from credible, third - party research, prioritizing findings from 2023 to 2025, with a global perspective and specific attention to regional variations in North America, EMEA, and APAC.

## 1. Organizational Characteristics

Understanding the foundational attributes of enterprise organizations is paramount, as these characteristics inherently shape their technology needs, procurement processes, and engagement preferences.

- ●
- Typical company size, IT team structure, and centralization. The "Enterprise" segment, for the purpose of this analysis, primarily refers to Global 2000 (G2000) organizations, which represent the largest publicly traded companies worldwide.1 These entities are characterized by substantial annual revenues, often in t he billions of dollars, and extensive employee bases, frequently numbering in the tens or hundreds of thousands. A defining feature of these organizations is their significant and accelerating reliance on digital capabilities; by 2026, it is projected that 40% of the total revenue for G2000 organizations will be generated by digital products, services, and experiences.1 This underscores a deep strategic commitment to leveraging technology for core
- business operations and market differentiation.

It is crucial to distinguish these large enterprises from "Midsize Enterprises (MSEs)." Gartner defines MSEs as organizations typically having between $50 million and $1 billion in annual revenues and/or 100 to 1000 employees. 2 MSEs often grapple with "limitations in IT staffing, skills and funding," with their internal IT teams generally comprising 10 to 50 individuals and IT budgets commonly falling between $5 million and $25 million, or approximately 4.5% of their annual revenue. 3

In stark contrast, G2000 enterprises possess significantly larger, more complex, and highly specialized IT departments, supported by substantially greater financial resources. Their IT structures are typically multifaceted, often employing a hybrid model t hat combines centralized IT governance for overarching strategy, standards, and security with federated or decentralized IT units embedded within specific business lines or geographic regions. This allows them to cater to localized needs while maintaining enterprise-wide coherence. The scale of these organizations necessitates dedicated teams for critical areas such as cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure management, data analytics, application development, and increasingly, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). This specialization differs from the more generalized IT roles often found in MSEs.

The scale of enterprise operations, while providing access to considerable resources, also introduces a unique set of challenges. These organizations must manage intricate legacy systems, ensure global operational consistency across diverse regulatory environments, coordinate geographically dispersed teams, and navigate the complexities of making agile decisions within large, often bureaucratic, structures. The integration of new technologies with existing, sometimes decades-old, legacy systems frequently consumes a substantial portion of IT budgets and human capital. Thus, while enterprises possess more resources, the effective and agile deployment of these resources for new technology adoption represents a significant hurdle, distinct from the sheer lack of resources often seen in smaller organizations. Vendors approaching this segment must therefore demonstrate not only the advanced capabilities of their solutions but also a clear, phased pathway for integration into complex existing environments, coupled with an understanding of the enterprise's capacity for change management.

Regional variations in talent distribution can also be observed. For instance, within the EMEA region, Accenture's UK Tech Talent Tracker (published June 20 25) indicates a significant concentration of technology vacancies (65%) and a striking 80 % of the demand for AI skills in London. 4  This suggests that major metropolitan hubs often serve as centers of excellence for specialized IT talent and advanced technology initiatives within large enterprises. Such concentrations of expertise can influence how technology providers engage with IT le adership, pointing towards these hubs for strategic discussions and talent acquisition related to cutting-edge technologies.

- ● Who owns the tech budget-IT, business, or shared? The ownership and governance of technology budgets within enterprise organizations are undergoing a significant transformation. Accenture's 20 25 report on IT operating models highlights a pivotal shift: "IT budgets are no longer allocated as a percentage of overall revenue... Instead, technology budgets are measured by value delivered per unit of investment... Investment governance and

funding decisions are made at the enterprise level, supported by the CIO".5 This indicates a clear movement towards strategic, value-driven, and centrally governed investment decisions, rather than purely departmental allocations. Further supporting this trend, a February 20 25 update from Deloitte noted that "only 52% of baseline organisations have a technology investment decisionmaking process jointly owned by IT and the business". 6  While this figure suggests that fully shared ownership is not yet universal, the direction is towards greater collaboration. The emerging ideal, as described by Accenture, involves enterprise-level governance where the CIO, in partnership with other C-suite executives (including the CFO and relevant business unit leaders), makes strategic investment decisions based on enterprise-wide value and strategic alignment. Gartner acknowledges the practical reality of distributed spending, stating that "IT spending/budget can come from anywhere in the enterprise that incurs IT costs, and it is not limited to the IT organization," encompassing decentralized IT spending and even "shadow IT". 7

The pervasive impact and strategic importance of technologies like AI are acting as powerful catalysts for this evolution in budget ownership. AI initiatives are rarely confined to a single department; they typically require access to crossfunctional data, impact multiple business processes, and necessitate enterprisewide considerations for ethics, security, and governance. 5  Siloed budgeting models are ill-equipped to effectively support such transformative, enterprisespanning technologies. Consequently, the CIO's role is evolving from that of a primary budget holder to a strategic advisor and a "regulator of technology and infrastructure," ensuring that all technology investments, regardless of their origin within the business, align with overarching enterprise goals and deliver measurable value. 5  While Line of Business (LOB) units may still initiate or fund specific technology projects to address their immediate operational needs, major investments, particularly those related to foundational or transformative technologies, are increasingly subject to this broader, collaborative scrutiny and enterprise-level approval.

- ● Role of partners, resellers, or integrators (vs. direct buying). The enterprise technology procurement landscape is characterized by a significant reliance on a diverse ecosystem of partners, including resellers, system integrators (SIs), and specialized service providers. Direct purchasing from vendors occurs, but it is often supplemented or primarily driven through these indirect channels, especially for complex solutions and large-scale deployments. Gartner's 20 24 Global Software Buying Trends report found that

"34% of software was purchased indirectly (via resellers, integrators or other third parties)".9

A critical factor driving this reliance on partners is the need for customization and specialized expertise. The same Gartner report revealed that "59% of software is customised for the buyer's unique usecase". 9  This level of tailoring often requires deep technical skills and industry-specific knowledge that vendors alone may not possess at the scale or specificity required by large enterprises. System integrators and specialized consultancies play a vital role in adapting solutions to fit complex existing IT environments and unique business processes. This points to a qualitative shift in the role of partners. Enterprises are not merely and AI implementation. These partners are expected to "add value across the life

McKinsey reinforces this by noting that "B2B tech customers are demanding expertise above all else... the channel is as important as ever... evolving into a richer ecosystem valued less for its distribution scale than for its expertise". 10 looking for fulfillment channels; they are seeking strategic allies who can provide specialized knowledge in areas like cybersecurity, cloud architecture, DevOps, cycle, from cocreation to co-selling to codelivery and sometimes to renewal and value realization". 10

The quality, specialization, and integration capabilities of a vendor's partner ecosystem are thus becoming increasingly important competitive differentiators in the enterprise market. As enterprises demand not just products but comprehensive solutions that address complex business challenges, the ability of a vendor to offer, or seamlessly connect the enterprise with, a network of capable and specialized partners is a critical element in the buyer's evaluation process. Enterprise buyers are, in effect, assessing not just the vendor's direct offerings but also the strength and capabilities of its extended ecosystem. Marketing and sales strategies for vendors targeting enterprises should therefore prominently feature their partner networks, highlighting the specialized value these partners bring and facilitating collaborative engagement models where appropriate.

- ● Common resource constraints or operational challenges.
- While G2000 enterprises command significantly larger overall resources compared to MSEs (which explicitly face "limitations in IT staffing, skills and funding" 3), they encounter a distinct set of resource constraints and operational challenges. These are often less about an absolute lack of budget or personnel and more about the strategic complexities of resource allocation and management at scale.

A pervasive challenge is "tech debt" -the implied cost of rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. McKinsey estimates that tech debt can add "an additional 10 to 20  percent cost on top of project costs". 11  This ongoing burden diverts significant financial and human resources away from new, innovative initiatives towards maintaining or rectifying legacy systems.

Furthermore, the "talent gap in key IT skillsets is widening," as highlighted by Gartner. 12 This scarcity is particularly acute for emerging and rapidly evolving technologies like artificial intelligence, data science, and advanced cybersecurity. Enterprises are often forced to compete for a limited pool of specialized talent or rely heavily on IT service firms and external consultants to bridge these skill gaps. 8

Cybersecurity and regulatory compliance also represent non-negotiable and substantial demands on enterprise resources. The increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, coupled with an ever-expanding landscape of data privacy and industry-specific regulations, necessitate continuous and significant investment in security technologies, processes, and personnel. 11  These expenditures, while critical for operational integrity and risk mitigation, further constrain the resources available for discretionary, growth-oriented technology projects.

Adding to these pressures, Forrester notes that the realization of return on investment (ROI) from AI initiatives is often taking longer than initially anticipated. 15 This can create internal pressure regarding the sustained allocation of resources to these strategically important but potentially long-gestation projects.

Collectively, these factors mean that enterprises effectively operate under an "innovation tax." Significant portions of their IT budgets and skilled personnel are consumed by the essential tasks of maintaining legacy infrastructure, managing tech debt, and ensuring robust security and compliance. This "tax" reduces the net resources available for pioneering new solutions or undertaking major digital transformations. Technology vendors proposing innovative solutions must therefore demonstrate how their offerings can either help reduce this existing burden (e.g., by modernizing legacy systems more efficiently, improving security posture with fewer resources) or deliver such compelling and clearly articulated business value that they justify the diversion of resources from these other critical, albeit less transformative, areas. Solutions that merely add to the existing complexity without addressing these underlying operational burdens will likely face significant challenges in securing funding and organizational buy - in.

- ● Level of digital maturity (e.g., cloud adoption, AI readiness).

Enterprise organizations generally exhibit a high level of engagement with advanced digital technologies. Cloud adoption, for instance, is largely mature and considered a foundational element of their IT strategy. Gartner projected that IT spending on cloud services would surpass $70 0  billion by the end of 20 24, driven by enterprise needs for enhanced scalability, operational flexibility, and cost control.16 BCG echoes this, identifying cloud services as "indispensable for scaling, resilience, and safe and reliable operations," and viewing them as "prerequisites for unleashing transformative technologies like AI".8 Regarding artificial intelligence, there is widespread experimentation and initial adoption. Accenture reports that "86% of executives plan to increase their investment in Generative AI in 20 25"  5 , and BCG found that "Four out of five responding companies have adopted some level of GenAI". 8  This indicates a strong appetite for exploring AI's potential.

However, a critical distinction exists between initial adoption and scaled, impactful maturity. Accenture's research revealed that "only 36% of executives say their organizations have scaled gen AI solutions, and just 13% report achieving significant enterprise-level impact". 17  Similarly, BCG reported that "only 26% of companies have developed the necessary set of capabilities to move beyond proofs of concept [for AI] and generate tangible value". 18  This disparity highlights what BCG terms an "AI impact gap"  19 , where the enthusiasm for AI and initial investments have yet to translate into widespread, measurable business transformation for many.

True digital maturity in the enterprise context extends beyond mere technology adoption. It encompasses the organizational capability to strategically integrate these technologies into core business processes, effectively reskill and upskill the workforce, adapt operational models, and consistently derive and measure business value from technology investments. McKinsey's research on "Lighthouse" enterprises-organizations recognized for their leadership in digital transformation-reveals that these mature entities invest significantly more (approximately four times as much) in "process and people enablers" compared to new technology itself. 20 Furthermore, these leading organizations are "developing solutions in-house 37 percent more often... primarily in roles related to AI architecture, design, and integration," indicating a commitment to building internal capabilities rather than solely relying on external solutions. 20 Regional variations in AI readiness are also apparent. Within EMEA, Accenture's data for the UK (June 2025) suggests that London - based organizations are comparatively "ahead in preparing for the impact of generative AI, investing more in training and technology" (58% of London firms increasing investment versus 40% of firms outside London). 4  This points to potential intra-regional differences in the pace of AI maturity development, even among large enterprises.

Therefore, while cloud infrastructure is a largely established and mature layer for enterprises must recognize this spectrum of maturity, tailoring their approach to most enterprises, AI readiness and the ability to translate AI investments into tangible, scaled business outcomes vary considerably. Vendors engaging with align with an organization's current capabilities and its strategic path towards deeper digital integration and value realization.

## 2. Buying Committee Dynamics

Enterprise technology decisions are rarely made by a single individual. Instead, they involve a complex interplay of multiple stakeholders, each with distinct priorities, concerns, and levels of influence.

- ● Typical number of stakeholders in tech decisions.
- Enterprise technology procurement typically involves a significant number of stakeholders. Gartner estimates that the average B2B buying group now consists of between six and ten people.21 Other research cited by B2B Marketing Zone, also referencing Gartne r, suggests this number can range from 11 to 20 people, and in some cases, particularly for complex enterprise technology, the buying team can include "more than 13 people".21 This multiplicity of voices reflects the cross-functional impact of most signifi cant technology investments in large organizations. These stakeholders bring diverse perspectives from IT, finance, legal, procurement, and various business units directly affected by the proposed technology. The challenge for vendors lies in navigating th is complex group, understanding individual motivations, and building consensus around a solution's value proposition.
- ● Who approves, influences, or blocks decisions. Within the enterprise buying committee, roles are distributed among approvers, influencers, and potential blockers.
- ○ Approvers: These are typically senior executives with budgetary authority, such as C-suite members (CEO, CFO, CIO), EVPs, or heads of major business divisions. Their approval is essential for the final sign - off.
- ○ Influencers: This is a broad category that can include IT architects, security specialists, end -user representatives, LOB managers, and subject matter

experts. While they may not have final approval power, their recommendations and assessments carry significant weight. Gartner notes that as technology budgets have spread, buying expertise has dispersed, le a ding to technology buyers who may lack a clear understanding of a technology's value or consensus within their teams. 22  External influencers, such as industry analysts, peer recommendations, and consultants, also play a role, with Forrester predicting that in 20 25, over 50 % of younger buyers will incorporate 10  or more external influencers in their decisions. 15

- ○ Blockers (or Gatekeepers): Individuals in roles such as procurement, legal, finance, or IT security can act as blockers if a solution does not meet compliance requirements, budget constraints, security standards, or integration capabilities. Their primary function is often risk mit igation and ensuring adherence to corporate policies. The dynamic nature of these roles means that a stakeholder might be an influencer in one phase and a blocker in another. Identifying and addressing the concerns of each key player is crucial for deal pr ogression.
- ● Role of procurement, finance, or legal in the process. Procurement, finance, and legal departments play increasingly strategic and integral roles in enterprise technology decisions, moving beyond purely transactional functions.
- ○ Procurement: The procurement function is evolving rapidly. McKinsey highlights that procurement is now "a prominent force in shaping corporate decision-making and resilience". 23 Modern procurement teams are "involved very early on, scoping and shaping the demands of the business, and then helping find the partners that the business needs". 23 Their focus extends beyond cost savings to include risk mitigation, supplier relationship management, ensuring compliance (including ESG goals), and fostering innovation. 24 Gartner advises procurement teams to assess their organization's digital maturity and sourcing objectives before selecting solutions and to evaluate AI capabilities and automation potential. 25 Best practices include identifying a broad range of viable suppliers, establishing clear scoring criteria upfront, conducting thorough due diligence, and informing losing bidders appropriately. 19 Common pitfalls include discarding smaller suppliers prematurely or over -relying on past experiences. 19
- ○ Finance:  The finance department is critical in evaluating the economic viability of technology investments. They scrutinize ROI projections, total cost of ownership (TCO), alignment with budgetary constraints, and preferred

pricing models (e.g., CapEx vs. OpEx). With the shift towards measuring technology budgets by "value delivered per unit of investment"  5 , finance plays a key role alongside the CIO and business leaders in investment governance.

- ○ Legal:  The legal department's involvement is crucial, particularly with the rise of AI and increasing data privacy regulations. Gartner notes that "Generative -AI-powered legal technology solutions are a top GC [General Counsel] priority in 2025," and "64% of leg al and compliance leaders report they plan to accelerate investments in legal technology" to handle complex workloads and budget restraints. 27 Legal teams assess contractual terms, data security and privacy implications (e.g., GDPR compliance), intellectual property rights, liability, and overall risk exposure associated with new technologies. Their input is vital for ensuring that technology ad option aligns with legal and regulatory obligations.
- External advisors and partner representatives frequently participate in the
- ● Involvement of external advisors or partner reps. enterprise buying process, often acting as key influencers.
- ○ External Advisors: These can include management consultants, industry analysts (from firms like Gartner, Forrester, IDC), and specialized technology consultants. Enterprises engage them for objective assessments, market insights, strategic guidance on technology roadmaps, v endor evaluations, and implementation best practices. Their recommendations can significantly shape the buying committee's perspectives and choices. Gartner, for instance, provides insight and guidance to tech operating partners to help them evaluate marke t position and align with buyer needs. 28
- ○ Partner Representatives: Given that a substantial portion of enterprise software is purchased indirectly and customized 9 , representatives from system integrators, value -added resellers (VARs), and managed service providers (MSPs) are often deeply involved. They may assist in defining requirements, demonstrating solutions, conducting proofs - of- concept, developing integration  plans, and providing post -implementation support. McKinsey notes the evolution of the channel towards an "ecosystem valued less for its distribution scale than for its expertise," with partners adding value across the entire lifecycle. 10 The ability of these partner reps to demonstrate deep technical and industry expertise is critical.

## 3. Buying Behavior and Sales Cycle

Enterprise technology buying is characterized by lengthy, complex processes and evolving preferences for engagement, increasingly favoring self-directed research and digital interaction.

- ● Average sales cycle length and complexity.
- Enterprise technology sales cycles are notoriously long and complex, often spanning multiple months, and in some cases, over a year. Forrester notes that B2B CX leaders are challenged by "multimonth sales cycles" and "multiple decision-makers".29 The complexity arises from the number of stakeholders involved (6-10  or more) 21, the need for thorough due diligence, extensive internal reviews (technical, security, legal, financial), integration with existing systems, and often, the requirement for customized solutions. Each stakeholder brings their own set of questions and priorities, which must be addressed, le a ding to multiple rounds of discussions, demonstrations, and negotiations. An interesting nuance highlighted by Forrester is that in their analysis of clients with reported sales cycles of nine to 12 months, "61% of their opportunities opened and closed in the same quarter, with an average of 56 days from open to close". 29 This suggests that while the overall journey from initial awareness to final decision can be protracted, the active "deal closing" phase might be more compressed once key internal alignments and decisions are made. It implies that much of the "length" of the cycle is spent in internal deliberation, consensusbuilding, and navigating procedural hurdles before a focused purchasing action takes place. Forrester also notes that marketers must respond to a "compressed sales cycle by reaching buyers before they enter an active sales cycle"  29 , indicating the importance of early engagement and brand building.
- ● Preferences for rep-led vs. self-directed buying.
- There is a strong and growing preference among enterprise buyers for selfdirected research and digital buying experiences, particularly in the initial stages of their journey. A Gartner report indicates that "nearly three-quarters (72%) of buyers prefer a seller-free buying experience".30  TrustRadius data further supports this, showing that in 20 21, 87% of buyers wanted to self-serve part or all of the journey, and by more recent measures, "virtually 10 0 % want to selfeducate and manage the buying experience on their own".30 Forrester predicts that by 20 25, "more than half of large B2B transactions (US$1 million or greater) will be processed through digital self-serve channels, including the vendor's website or marketplaces". 15  This shift is significantly influenced by the increasing presence of Millennials and Gen Z in buying committees, who are digital natives and expect seamless, on-demand access to information. Gartner

also reports that B2B buyers spend only 17% of the total purchase journey interacting directly with sales reps from potential suppliers. 21

This does not eliminate the role of sales representatives but reshapes it. Reps are becoming more crucial in later stages for complex consultations, solution customization, and navigating intricate deal structures. However, during the awareness, consideration, and initial evaluation phases, buyers increasingly rely on vendor websites, online reviews, peer communities, analyst reports, and other digital resources to gather information and form initial shortlists. 9  This necessitates a robust digital presence and readily accessible, high-quality content from vendors.

- ● Use of POCs, trials, or pilots.
- Proofs of Concept (POCs), trials, and pilot programs are commonly used by enterprise buyers to evaluate the feasibility, functionality, and potential business impact of technology solutions before committing to a full-scale investment.31 These mechanisms serve several critical functions:
- ○ Feasibility Demonstration: A POC helps demonstrate that a proposed product, method, or idea will work in the real - world context of the enterprise, providing tangible evidence to stakeholders. 31
- ○ Risk Mitigation: By testing a solution on a smaller scale, enterprises can identify potential challenges, integration issues, and performance limitations, thereby mitigating the financial and operational risks associated with a large deployment. 31
- ○ User Feedback and Validation: Trials and pilots allow key users to interact with the solution, providing valuable feedback on usability, features, and alignment with their needs. This feedback is crucial for refining requirements and ensuring user adoption. 31
- ○ Value Assessment: These preliminary implementations help the buying committee assess the potential ROI and business value the solution can deliver, strengthening the business case for investment. A Forrester Total Economic Impact (TEI) study commissioned by Pendo, for exam ple, quantified benefits such as faster app adoption, reduced support tickets, and cost savings, demonstrating the kind of outcomes enterprises look for from such evaluations. 32 While POCs and trials add time to the overall sales cycle, they are often a prerequisite for major technology acquisitions in the enterprise segment, providing a necessary level of assurance before significant capital is committed.
- ● Typical friction points or deal blockers.

Enterprise technology sales cycles are fraught with potential friction points and deal blockers that can stall or derail opportunities.

- ○ Lack of Consensus: With 6 to 10 or more decision -makers involved  21 , achieving consensus on needs, priorities, and the best solution is a major challenge. Gartner notes that 95% of buying groups revisit decisions at least once as new information emerges. 21
- ○ Integration Complexity: Integrating new technology with existing legacy systems is a primary concern and a frequent source of friction. The ability to support this integration process is the number one sales - related factor in driving a software decision. 9
- ○ Budgetary Constraints and ROI Justification: Securing budget approval requires a compelling business case with clear ROI. If the perceived value does not justify the cost, or if the ROI timeline is too long, finance departments can block the deal. McKinsey points to the misalignment of incentives, where tech delivery is rewarded over business -wide value, leading to a 20 -30% loss of value and poor spend decisions. 11
- ○ Security and Compliance Concerns: Failure to meet stringent enterprise security standards or regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., data privacy, industry -specific mandates) is a common deal breaker. Legal and security teams play a crucial gatekeeping role here. 27
- ○ Change Management Resistance: Resistance to change from end -users or departments comfortable with existing processes can hinder adoption and stall deals.
- ○ Vendor -Related Issues: Poor vendor reputation, lack of adequate technical support, unclear pricing, or a perceived lack of understanding of the enterprise's specific needs can erode trust and lead to stalled deals. Buyers list security certification, reputation, or data privacy practices as top reasons for selecting a vendor, followed by technical support capabilities or uptime guarantees. 9
- ○ External Factors: Economic uncertainty, budget freezes, or unexpected shifts in company strategy can also halt procurement processes. 33 IDC's research into CX technology buyers aims to identify common friction points related to selection, contracting, and management 34 , underscoring the industry's focus on understanding and mitigating these challenges.

## 4. Budget and ROI Expectations

Enterprise technology investments involve significant financial outlay, and as such, are subject to rigorous budgetary scrutiny and demanding ROI expectations.

- ● Typical spend ranges or deal sizes.
- Enterprise technology deal sizes can vary dramatically based on the scope of the solution, the size of the enterprise, and the type of technology being procured. While specific global averages for all enterprise tech deals are broad, data from related segments provides context. For private SaaS companies, the median Annual Contract Value (ACV) is around $22,357, but this figure is strongly correlated with company size; for instance, companies with $5 - $10  million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) show a median ACV of $33,70 4.35 Enterprise deals, particularly for G20 0 0  companies, would typically be orders of magnitude larger, often running into hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars annually, especially for core platforms like ERP, CRM, or extensive cloud service agreements. Accenture, for example, refers to its largest client relationships as "Diamond clients," which numbered 30 0  in fiscal 20 23, indicating substantial, ongoing engagements.36 The Configure Price Quote (CPQ) market, often serving enterprises, is projected to reach between $3.4 billion and $8 billion by the early 20 30 s, with solutions catering to companies with revenues from &lt;$50 M USD to over $10 B+ USD.37 This wide range in user company size for CPQ solutions implies a correspondingly wide range in deal sizes. B2B eCommerce transactions are also typically larger in quantity and for higher dollar amounts than B2C.39
- ● ROI expectations and key metrics. Enterprises have high ROI expectations for technology investments, with a strong focus on measurable business outcomes. The emphasis is shifting towards technology budgets being measured by "value delivered per unit of investment".5 Key metrics and approaches include:
- ○ Business Value Realization: The primary expectation is that technology will deliver tangible business benefits such as increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, enhanced customer experience, cost reduction, or risk mitigation. 40
- ○ Rule of 40:  For SaaS businesses, the "Rule of 40" (where the sum of annual revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin should exceed 40%) is a key benchmark for financial health and performance, balancing growth with profitability. 41 Other metrics like Gross Revenue Retention (GRR), Net Revenue Retention (NRR), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Lifetime Value (LTV) are also critical. 41
- ○ Total Economic Impact (TEI): Forrester's TEI methodology is a rigorous framework used to justify, quantify, and articulate the full economic value of

an investment, considering benefits, costs, risks, and flexibility. 42 Enterprises often look for or conduct such analyses to validate potential ROI. A TEI study for Pendo, for example, showed a composite organization achieving $3.81 million in benefits over three years from a $765,0 0 0  investment, with a payback period of less than six months. 32

- ○ AI-Specific ROI:  For AI investments, while belief in the technology is high, tangible returns can be elusive. A BCG survey found that the median reported ROI for AI and GenAI in finance teams was just 10%, below the 20% many target. 44 Success in achieving higher ROI from AI often depends on focusing on value from the start, embedding AI into broader transformation, active collaboration, and executing in well - sequenced, scalable steps. 44 IDC also emphasizes demonstrating the ROI of IT solutions to ignite demand and accelerate sales cycles, often through business value white papers and interactive selling tools. 45
- ● Preferences for pricing models (e.g., CapEx vs. OpEx, subscription vs. license). The dominant preference in enterprise software is overwhelmingly towards subscription -based, Operating Expenditure (OpEx) models, characteristic of Software -as-a-Service (SaaS). This shift from traditional perpetual licenses (Capital Expenditure  - CapEx) has been driven by several factors:
- ○ Flexibility and Scalability: Subscription models allow enterprises to scale their usage up or down based on changing needs, providing greater agility. 16
- ○ Lower Upfront Costs: OpEx models avoid large initial capital outlays, making it easier to budget for and adopt new technologies.
- ○ Predictable Recurring Costs: Annual or monthly subscription fees offer more predictable budgeting compared to large, infrequent license purchases and maintenance contracts.
- ○ Access to Innovation: SaaS models typically include ongoing updates and access to the latest features without requiring major upgrade projects. Common SaaS pricing models encountered in the enterprise space include
- ○ Tiered Pricing (Good, Better, Best): Offering different packages with varying levels of features and capacity.
- ○ Per-User or Per -Seat Pricing: Common for collaboration and productivity tools.
- ○ Usage-Based Pricing: Charges based on actual consumption of resources (e.g., data storage, API calls, processing power). This is gaining traction for services where consumption can vary significantly.
- ○ Feature -Based Pricing: Allowing customers to select and pay for specific

47

:

features they need.

- ○ Hybrid Pricing: Combining elements of different models, such as a base subscription with usage -based charges for premium features or peak demand. While OpEx is preferred for software and cloud services, hardware procurement (e.g., for data centers) may still involve CapE x, though consumption -based models for infrastructure are also becoming more common.
- ● Appetite for long -term contracts or vendor lock - in.

Enterprises generally approach long -term contracts and potential vendor lock

- in with caution, though their appetite can vary based on the strategic importance of

the technology and the perceived stability of the vendor.

- ○ Preference for Flexibility: The desire for agility and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing technological landscapes often leads to a preference for shorter contract terms or contracts with flexible exit clauses. This is particularly true for newer technologies where the market is still evolving.
- ○ Strategic Partnerships: For core, mission-critical systems (e.g., ERP, core banking systems, strategic cloud platforms), enterprises may be more willing to enter into longer - term contracts, especially if the vendor is viewed as a strategic partner offering significant value, sta bility, and a clear innovation roadmap. Gartner notes that offering longer - term contracts can be an incentive for suppliers to improve their capabilities. 48
- ○ Concerns about Lock - in:  Vendor lock-in is a significant concern. Enterprises are wary of becoming overly dependent on a single vendor's proprietary technology, which can limit future choices, increase switching costs, and reduce negotiating power. They often favor solutions base d on open standards or those offering robust APIs for integration with other systems to mitigate this risk.
- ○ Balancing Cost and Commitment: Longer-term contracts can sometimes offer more favorable pricing, creating a trade - off between cost savings and reduced flexibility. Procurement and finance teams will carefully weigh these factors. The rise of multi -cloud strategies and the emphasis on c omposable architectures reflect a broader enterprise desire to avoid deep lock - in with any single provider, even for critical infrastructure.

## 5. Messaging and Content Preferences

Effective communication with enterprise buyers requires a deep understanding of their information needs, preferred content formats, and the channels through which they engage. Messaging must be value - driven, outcome-focused, and tailored to diverse stakeholder personas.

- ● Preferred formats (e.g., calculators, case studies, analyst proof). Enterprise buyers, particularly during their self-directed research phase, seek substantive, credible, and educational content that helps them understand complex problems and evaluate potential solutions. Their preferences lean towards formats that provide tangible evidence and clear value articulation:
- ○ Analyst Proof: Reports, white papers, and evaluations from respected third -party analyst firms (e.g., Gartner, Forrester, IDC) carry significant weight. Inclusion in Gartner Magic Quadrants or Forrester Waves, for example, is often a key consideration. 37 Buyers use this content to validate vendor claims and understand market positioning.
- ○ Case Studies and Customer Success Stories: Demonstrating real -world success through detailed case studies is highly effective. Buyers want to see how peers have solved similar challenges and achieved measurable results with a vendor's solution. These narratives build credibility and help buyers visualize the potential impact on their own organizations.
- ○ ROI Calculators and Business Value Assessment Tools: Tools that allow buyers to quantify the potential economic benefits and ROI of a solution are highly valued. 45 Forrester's TEI framework is an example of a methodology that resonates because it provides a structured approach to understanding financial impact. 42
- ○ Technical Documentation and White Papers: For technical stakeholders, detailed documentation, architectural diagrams, and in - depth white papers explaining the technology, security features, and integration capabilities are essential. 9
- ○ Product Demonstrations and Videos: Visual demonstrations of the product in action, showcasing key features and user experience, are crucial.
- ○ Webinars and Online Events: These provide opportunities for deeper dives into specific topics, Q&amp;A with experts, and learning about industry trends. Gartner emphasizes that buyers in the information - gathering stage want "specific detail that can help them learn about the problem and your solution" to remove fear and anxiety. 9
- ● Tone and value framing that build trust. Building trust with enterprise buyers hinges on messaging that is authentic, transparent, and relentlessly focused on their business priorities and challenges.
- ○ Business Outcome Focus: Messaging should clearly articulate how the

technology solution helps the enterprise achieve its strategic goals, such as increasing revenue, improving employee productivity, enhancing customer experience, reducing costs, or mitigating risks. 40 Technology features should be framed in terms of the business benefits they enable.

- ○ Empathy and Understanding: Demonstrating a deep understanding of the buyer's industry, specific challenges, and operational context is crucial. Generic messaging fails to resonate.
- ○ Data - Driven and Evidence - Based:  Claims should be backed by credible data, research, and real -world examples (e.g., case studies, benchmarks).
- ○ Transparency: Openness about pricing, capabilities, limitations, and implementation requirements builds trust. Hiding information or overpromising can quickly erode credibility.
- ○ Educational and Consultative Tone: Buyers appreciate vendors who act as trusted advisors, offering valuable insights and helping them navigate complex decisions, rather than just pushing a product.
- ○ Security and Reliability Emphasis: Given the high stakes, messaging that underscores security certifications, data privacy practices, reliability, and robust technical support is paramount. 9
- Certain messaging approaches are consistently ineffective or even detrimental
- ● Messaging approaches that fail in this segment. when targeting enterprise buyers:
- ○ Technology - Centric Messaging: Focusing excessively on product features and technical jargon without connecting them to business value is a common mistake. Gartner explicitly advises that "differentiation and messaging strategies should not start with technology, which is just a means to an end". 40
- ○ Generic, One -Size-Fits -All Content: Enterprises expect personalized and contextually relevant information. Generic marketing collateral that doesn't address their specific industry, size, or challenges is often ignored.
- ○ Overhyping and Unsubstantiated Claims: Exaggerated claims about product capabilities or ROI that cannot be backed by credible evidence quickly lead to skepticism and loss of trust. Forrester warns that "Thinly customized GenAI content will further degrade the purchase experience for 70% of B2B buyers"  49 , highlighting the risk of superficial AI - generated content.
- ○ Ignoring the Buying Committee's Diversity: Failing to tailor messaging to the different personas within the buying committee (e.g., IT vs. LOB, finance

vs. technical users) means key concerns may go unaddressed. 40

- ○ High - Pressure Sales Tactics: Enterprise buying decisions are deliberate and consensus-driven. Aggressive or overly persistent sales tactics are generally counterproductive.
- ○ Lack of Transparency: Obscuring pricing, making it difficult to access detailed information, or being evasive about potential challenges can create suspicion.
- ● Channels or forums where buyers in this segment engage with vendors. Enterprise buyers utilize a mix of digital and traditional channels to engage with vendors and gather information:
- ○ Vendor Websites: Often the first port of call for product information, technical specifications, case studies, and white papers. Ease of navigation and access to ungated, valuable content are critical. 9
- ○ Industry Analyst Firms: Reports and consultations from firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC are highly influential throughout the buying journey. 50
- ○ Peer Networks and Communities: Buyers often consult with peers in similar organizations to learn about their experiences with vendors and solutions. Online communities and professional forums play a role here.
- ○ Social Media (Professional Networks): LinkedIn is a key platform for B2B engagement, research, and connecting with industry experts and vendor representatives. 51 Forrester notes that in 2025, more than 50% of younger buyers will rely on external sources, including social media, to help make buying decisions. 15
- ○ Industry Events and Conferences: These provide opportunities for face - to face interactions, product demonstrations, and learning about market trends (though the nature of these events has evolved with more virtual/hybrid options).
- ○ Third - Party Review Sites: Platforms like G2 and TrustRadius are increasingly consulted for user reviews and comparisons.
- ○ Partner Channels: Engagements with resellers, integrators, and consultants are crucial, as these partners often act as trusted advisors. 9
- ○ Direct Sales Interactions: While buyers prefer self -service for initial research, direct engagement with knowledgeable sales representatives and solution architects becomes important for tailored demonstrations, complex Q&amp;A, and deal negotiation. 21
- ● Level of marketing sophistication -are turnkey assets or enablement tools commonly needed?

Enterprise buyers are highly sophisticated and expect a commensurate level of sophistication from vendor marketing. They are generally not receptive to overly simplistic or "turnkey" assets if these lack depth and substance.

- ○ Demand for Depth and Customization: Buyers require detailed, specific information tailored to their context. 9 Generic, off -the-shelf marketing materials are often perceived as unhelpful. Forrester's research indicates that 59% of purchasing decision -makers find the marketing materials they receive from vendors useless. 42
- ○ Enablement for Internal Champions: While buyers are sophisticated, they often need enablement tools to help them build the business case internally and navigate their own complex buying processes. This can include customizable ROI calculators, presentation templates, security documentation , and comparison guides that their internal champions can use to persuade other stakeholders.
- ○ Content Intelligence and Personalization: Forrester highlights the growing importance of "content intelligence" -capturing and analyzing data about content consumption to inform buyer insights and deliver more personalized engagement. 52  AI is being leveraged to create metadata and extract buying signals to tailor content effectively.
- ○ Sophistication in Delivery: Buyers expect seamless digital experiences. Vendor websites should be easy to navigate, with information readily accessible. Self-service portals for pricing estimation or product configuration are increasingly expected. 30 While "turnkey" might imply simplicity, what enterprises truly value is clarity, depth, and relevance. Enablement tools are valuable not because they are simple, but because they empower the buyer to effectively articulate the solution's value within thei r own organization.

## 6. Frictions and Blockers

Navigating the enterprise sales process is often challenging due to a variety of internal and external factors that can stall or derail deals. Understanding these common frictions and blockers is essential for vendors seeking to effectively engage this segment.

- ● Internal dynamics or structural barriers that stall deals. The internal workings of large enterprises frequently present structural barriers
- and complex dynamics that can impede the progress of technology procurement:
- ○ Misaligned Incentives and Priorities: A significant challenge, as highlighted

by McKinsey, is that incentives within the enterprise often reward technology delivery over the realization of business-wide value. Business leaders funding IT projects may not be accountable for the full lifecycle costs, leading to suboptimal investment decisions and a potential 20 -30 % loss of value. 11  This can lead to internal disagreements about the true benefit or cost of a proposed solution.

- ○ Siloed Decision - Making and Lack of Consensus: Despite the trend towards more collaborative budget governance, departmental silos can persist. Different departments may have conflicting priorities or perspectives on a technology's value, making it difficult to achieve the necessary consensus among the  6-10+ stakeholders typically involved. 21 Gartner notes that 95% of buying groups revisit decisions 21 , indicating the iterative and often contentious nature of internal alignment.
- ○ Resistance to Change: Entrenched processes and cultural resistance to adopting new ways of working can be a major hurdle. Employees comfortable with existing systems or workflows may push back against solutions that require significant behavioral shifts, regardless of the pote ntial benefits.
- ○ Bureaucratic Processes and "Red Tape": Large organizations often have complex, multi -layered approval processes involving numerous departments (IT, finance, legal, procurement, security). Navigating these internal bureaucracies can be time -consuming and lead to significant delays.
- ○ "Pilot Purgatory": McKinsey points out that many organizations struggle to move beyond proof -of-concept models and AI -based applications that have no chance of scaling, a phenomenon dubbed "pilot purgatory". 53 This often results from a lack of clear strategy for scaling or insufficient focus on enterprise -wide applicability from the outset.
- ○ Internal Politics: Unspoken agendas, power struggles between departments, or the influence of key individuals with personal preferences can subtly or overtly block deals that do not align with their interests. While not explicitly detailed in all provided research for gener al enterprise sales, the example of TfL dropping Accenture due to DEI misalignment shows how internal values and political stances can become deal blockers, even if the context is specific. 54
- ● Common objections or organizational blockers. Beyond internal dynamics, specific objections and organizational blockers frequently arise:
- ○
- Cost and Budget Justification: The most common objection revolves

around the cost of the solution and the ability to demonstrate a clear, compelling, and timely ROI. If the business case is weak or the financial benefits are not clearly articulated, finance departments or budget holders will block the purchase. 5

- ○ Integration Challenges and Tech Debt: Concerns about the complexity and cost of integrating a new solution with existing legacy systems are paramount. The "tax" of tech debt, which McKinsey notes can add 10 - 20% to project costs, makes organizations wary of solutions that exacerbate this probl em. 11 The ability to support integration is a top sales - related factor. 9
- ○ Security and Compliance Risks: Any perceived weakness in a solution's security posture or its inability to meet data privacy regulations (like GDPR) or industry -specific compliance standards will be a hard stop, typically raised by IT security, legal, or compliance teams. 11
- ○ Lack of Perceived Need or Urgency: If the problem the solution addresses is not seen as a high priority or if there isn't a strong sense of urgency, the initiative can easily be deprioritized in favor of more pressing issues. 22
- ○ Vendor Viability and Reputation: Concerns about a vendor's long -term viability, financial stability, level of support, or past performance can act as blockers. Buyers prioritize vendors with strong reputations for data privacy and technical support. 9
- ○ Insufficient Customization or Scalability: If a solution cannot be adequately customized to meet the enterprise's unique use case or if it lacks the ability to scale with future growth, it will likely be rejected. Gartner found 59% of software is customized. 9
- ● External factors (e.g., budget freezes, procurement delays). Deals can also be stalled or blocked by factors outside the direct control of the
- vendor or the immediate buying committee:
- ○ Economic Uncertainty and Budget Freezes: Broader economic downturns, industry -specific financial pressures, or unexpected geopolitical events can lead to company -wide budget freezes or cuts, impacting discretionary IT spending. 13 Accenture Federal Services, for example, experienced delays and contract cancellations due to federal IT spending cuts. 55
- ○ Regulatory Changes: New or evolving regulations can force organizations to reprioritize IT investments towards compliance - related projects, diverting funds from other planned initiatives. 13
- ○ Market Volatility and Shifting Priorities: Rapid changes in the market landscape or competitive pressures can cause enterprises to abruptly shift

their strategic priorities, leading to the abandonment or postponement of previously approved technology projects.

- ○ Supply Chain Disruptions: For hardware-dependent solutions, global supply chain disruptions can lead to significant delays in deployment, impacting project timelines and potentially causing deals to be reconsidered. Deloitte noted the need for tech leaders to diversify supply chai ns for redundancy due to geopolitical unrest and supply chain volatility. 14
- ○ Procurement Process Delays: Even with internal agreement, the formal procurement process itself can be lengthy and subject to delays due to workload, staffing issues within the procurement department, or complex negotiation requirements.
- ● Where vendors tend to overestimate readiness or urgency. Vendors often misjudge the enterprise's actual readiness to adopt a new technology or the true urgency of the problem the solution addresses.
- ○ Overestimating AI/GenAI Maturity: While there's high interest in AI, vendors may overestimate how prepared an enterprise is to move beyond pilots to full - scale, value- generating deployments. Only a small percentage of companies have truly scaled AI solutions to achieve significant enterpr iselevel impact. 17 The primary roadblocks for GenAI adoption have shifted from data risks to identifying clear business benefits and use cases, managing organizational change, and securing talent. 8
- ○ Underestimating Change Management Requirements: Vendors might focus on the technical merits of their solution without fully appreciating the significant organizational change, process redesign, and employee upskilling required for successful adoption in a large enterprise. 20
- ○ Assuming Universal Understanding of Value: Vendors may assume that the value proposition, so clear to them, is equally understood and prioritized across all stakeholders in the buying committee. However, different departments will have different perspectives and pain points. 40
- ○ Misinterpreting Initial Enthusiasm as Purchase Commitment: Positive feedback during initial discussions or demonstrations does not always translate into immediate purchasing action. The internal journey to secure budget and consensus can be long and arduous. 29
- ○ Overlooking Competing Priorities: An enterprise is constantly juggling multiple initiatives. A vendor's solution, while valuable, may not be at the top of the current priority list due to other pressing business needs or ongoing projects. Gartner highlights that technology buying teams ar e more

motivated when a tech purchase addresses organization - le ve l s tra te gic goals; needs at the initiative or business function level risk being sidelined. 22

## 7. Strategic Insights for Marketers

Targeting the enterprise segment effectively requires a nuanced understanding of their complex organizational structures, decision - making processes, and specific expectations. Marketing strategies must transcend product - centric pitches and focus on delivering demonstrable business value, fostering trust, and enabling buyers through their intricate journey.

- ● Three key takeaways marketers should remember when targeting this segment.
- 1. Emphasize Demonstrable Business Value and ROI Over Technical Features:  Enterprise buyers, particularly the C -suite and LOB leaders who increasingly influence or control technology budgets 5 , are primarily concerned with how a technology investment will impact key business outcomes such as revenue growth, operational efficiency, customer experience, and risk mitigation. 40 Messaging should lead with these benefits, supported by quantifiable evidence like case studies, ROI calculators, and analyst validations. 9 Technical features are secondary and should only be detailed to the extent that they directly enable these desired business outcomes. As Gartner advises, "differentiation and messaging strategies should not start with technology, which is just a means to an end". 40 The focus on value is paramount, especially as ROI from complex technologies like AI can take longer than anticipated to materialize. 15
- 2. Navigate the Complex Buying Committee with Persona - Tailored Engagement:  Enterprise technology decisions involve an average of 6 - 10 (and sometimes more) stakeholders 21 , each with distinct roles, priorities, and concerns (IT, LOB, finance, procurement, legal). 23 A one-size-fits -all marketing approach will fail. Marketers must develop deep buyer personas and tailor content and messaging to address the specific needs and language of each key stakeholder group. For IT buyers, this might mean focusing on integration,  scalability, and security; for LOB leaders, it's about solving business problems and achieving strategic objectives; for finance, it's about the business case and ROI. 40  Understanding and mapping the influence network within the target enterprise is crucial.
- 3. Enable the Self - Directed Buyer and Support the Entire Journey: Enterprise buyers overwhelmingly prefer to conduct their own research,

especially in the early stages of the buying process, with 72% preferring a seller-free experience. 30 Forrester predicts over half of large B2B transactions will be processed via digital self-serve channels by 20 25. 15 Marketers must provide comprehensive, easily accessible, and high-quality digital content (detailed product information, case studies, white papers, analyst reports, security documentation) that educates buyers and helps them build a shortlist. 9 This content should be available without aggressive gating. Furthermore, marketing's role extends beyond lead generation to supporting the entire, often lengthy, sales cycle by providing enablement tools for internal champions and fostering consistent engagement across all touchpoints.

- ● Where messaging or strategy often misses the mark.
- ○ Overemphasis on Product Features, Underemphasis on Business
- Solutions: A common pitfall is leading with product features and technical specifications rather than clearly articulating how the solution solves specific enterprise -level business problems and delivers measurable value. As Sharyn Leaver, Chief Research Officer at  Forrester, stated, "In 2025, leaders must prioritize improving revenue processes and reorient their growth strategies around their customers" 15 , implying a need for customer -centric, value driven messaging.
- ○ Failure to Address the "Why" for Diverse Stakeholders: Messaging often fails to resonate because it doesn't adequately address the unique "why" for each member of the buying committee. IT might care about technical feasibility, finance about cost savings, and a business unit about market agility. Generic messaging that doesn't speak to these varied motivations will be ineffective. Gartner highlights the need to connect messaging to "buyers' business priorities" and tailor it for both IT and LOB audiences. 40
- ○ Not Substantiating Claims with Credible Proof Points: Enterprise buyers are skeptical and demand evidence. Marketing that makes bold claims about ROI or performance without backing them up with robust case studies, third -party analyst validation (like Gartner or Forrester reports), or clear data will lack credibility. "Buyers listed security certification, reputation or data privacy practices as the top reason they selected a vendor," 9 indicating the need for verifiable proof in critical areas.
- ○ Underestimating the Importance of Integration and Partnership Ecosystem:  Enterprises operate complex IT environments. Messaging that overlooks or downplays the challenges of integration with existing systems, or

fails to highlight a strong partner ecosystem capable of delivering customization and specialized support, misses a key buyer concern. 9

- ○ Treating APAC as a Monolithic Market: For global campaigns, a frequent misstep is applying a uniform strategy across the APAC region. Forrester emphasizes that "APAC is not a monolith. Business etiquette and buyer expectations vary widely across the different countries" (e.g., Japan, Australia, China, India). 56 Marketing must be culturally nuanced and address specific local business drivers and communication styles. For example, price is initially less of a determining factor in APAC than in North America or Europe, but cost concerns can stall deals later. 56
- ● Analyst Quotes or Citations from 2023 -2025:
- ○ On AI Investment and Value: "Leaders are realizing that ROI from AI investments will take longer than they anticipated. Impatience with AI ROI could prompt enterprises to prematurely scale back investments, which would be a long -term disadvantage."  - Forrester, 2025 B2B Marketing &amp;  Sales Predictions (October 2024). 15
- ○ On IT Services and Talent Gap: 'IT services are poised to become the largest market segment we track, with spending expected to surge 9.7% to a staggering $1.52 trillion. The talent gap in key IT skillsets is widening, causing enterprises to turn increasingly to IT service firms for ex pertise.'  -  JohnDavid Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner (April 2024). 12
- ○ On AI's Role in IT Budgets: "AI and generative AI (GenAI), along with enabling technologies like cloud services and security, should see the largest spending increases in 2025. The biggest decreases will be in established areas such as systems and services management, devices, and s erver infrastructure." -  BCG, "AI Shifts IT Budgets to Growth Investments" (April 2025). 8
- ○ On GenAI Content Degrading Buyer Experience: "Thinly customized GenAI content will further degrade the purchase experience for 70% of B2B buyers." -  Forrester Research, cited in Commercetools Blog (2024). 49 This highlights the need for quality and relevance in AI -assisted content.
- ○ On the Evolving Role of Procurement: 'Right now what we're seeing is procurement is involved very early on, scoping and shaping the demands of the business, and then helping find the partners that the business needs -short -term partners and long -term partners.'  - Jennifer Spaulding Schmidt, Senior Partner, McKinsey (May 2025). 23
- ○ On Enterprise Intelligence and Decision Velocity:
- "Enterprise intelligence

allows organizations to thrive in all macroeconomic conditions. Predictions in this IDC FutureScape detail key trends that are going to occur in the next one to five years that executives should be aware of as they strive to increase their enterprise intelligence." - Chandana Gopal, Research Director, IDC's Future of Intelligence (October 20 23). 57

- ○ On the Shift to Self - Serve Buying: "Generational buying shifts, combined with the rapid rise of generative AI, are fundamentally altering the B2B buying landscape." - Sharyn Leaver, Chief Research Officer at Forrester (October 2024). 15

By internalizing these strategic insights and adapting their approaches accordingly, marketers can significantly improve their effectiveness in engaging and converting enterprise technology buyers in the dynamic 2023 - 2025 landscape.
