## Navigating the Evolving Landscape: B2B Technology Buyer Behavior in Media &amp; Entertainment

## 1. Industry Context

The Media &amp; Entertainment (M&amp;E) sector is undergoing a period of profound transformation, shaped by a confluence of technological advancements, shifting consumer behaviors, and evolving economic realities. Understanding this dynamic context is paramount fo r B2B technology vendors seeking to effectively engage with and provide value to M&amp;E organizations.

## Major trends, economic forces, and transformation drivers

The M&amp;E industry is characterized by continuous disruption and convergence. This is not merely a result of the growth of streaming, social media, and gaming, but stems from the intricate ways these media forms and their underlying technologies are interwea ving, thereby creating novel hybrid experiences and business models. 1 Consumer expectations are increasingly molded by the immediacy and interactivity of social media, the influence of content creators, and the immersive nature of video games, often more so than by traditional television and film productions. 1 This convergence acts as a primary catalyst for technology investments capable of bridging these once -distinct domains.

Economic pressures significantly influence the M&amp;E landscape. Companies are grappling with the escalating costs associated with producing premium content. 2 Concurrently, consumers are exhibiting increased price sensitivity and "subscription fatigue," a weariness stemming from managing multiple subscriptions. 1 This dynamic compels M&amp;E firms to explore more efficient production methodologies and diversify their monetization strategies. FTI Delta's analysis points to a more subdued recovery in content production in 2024 following industry strikes, a direct conseq uence of streaming services reprioritizing profitability in the face of plateauing subscriber growth. 6 This environment underscores a critical need for technologies that can optimize content return on investment (ROI) and support agile business model pivots. The challenge of managing numerous subscriptions and their rising costs is not solely a consumer inconvenience; it actively forces a fundamental re - evaluation of content value and the supporting technology infrastructures. This pressure leads to higher churn rates and greater price sensitivity among consumers 4 , compelling M&amp;E companies to move beyond singular reliance on subscription growth towards diversified revenue streams like ad -supported tiers and bundled offerings. 3

Consequently, B2B technology buyers in this sector will increasingly prioritize solutions that offer modularity, scalability, and robust support for these hybrid monetization models, viewing technology as an enabler of business agility rather than a fixed operational cost.

The ascent of the creator economy and user-generated content (UGC) introduces another layer of complexity and competition. Independent creators and UGC platforms are formidable forces, vying for audience attention and advertising revenue, thereby democratizing content creation but also challenging established M&amp;E players. 2  Deloitte highlights that consumer expectations are now frequently shaped more by social media and individual creators than by traditional media outlets. 1 This shift blurs the lines between professional and amateur content, opening avenues for B2B technology vendors. Opportunities exist for "prosumer" tools that can scale from individual creators to small studios, as well as for enterprise-grade solutions that enable larger M&amp;E companies to effectively manage, moderate, or collaborate with this burgeoning creator ecosystem. Traditional M&amp;E companies are increasingly looking to leverage creators for their authenticity and reach  1 , creating a dual market for technology: tools empowering creators themselves (in areas like editing, streaming, and monetization) and platforms for enterprises to discover, manage, and analyze the impact of creator collaborations.

There is a definitive shift away from legacy media models. Traditional advertising revenues are declining, compelling companies to transform into content creators themselves, with a heightened focus on authentic storytelling and direct engagement with their audiences. 5  FTI Delta forecasts a continued contraction of linear television and print sectors, with growth concentrated in digital and direct-to-consumer (DTC) businesses, which often operate on thinner profit margins. 6  Audience fragmentation further complicates the landscape, with viewers dispersed across a multitude of platforms and devices, making it increasingly difficult to capture and retain their attention. 4

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI (GenAI), stands out as a major transformative force. It is profoundly impacting content creation, personalization capabilities, and cost control measures, while also prompting fundamental discussions about the balance between human creativity and AI-generated content. 1 A Deloitte study reveals that while 70 % of consumers express a preference for human-written content, a notable segment recognizes the potential for AI to produce entertaining material. 1

- ● Risk Aversion: Generally, ITDMs exhibit a degree of risk aversion. They tend to prioritize proven, well -established solutions and may be cautious about adopting bleeding-edge technologies without clear evidence of their stability, security, and tangible benefits within a similar M&amp;E context. 34  Their role often involves conducting thorough risk assessments of new technology adoption. 33
- ● Standardization &amp; Governance: ITDMs often prefer solutions that align with existing enterprise technology standards and governance frameworks. This approach helps maintain control, simplifies management, ensures interoperability, and reduces complexity across the IT landscape. 25

## How business decision makers (BDMs) frame goals, value, and buying criteria

Business decision makers in M&amp;E, who may come from creative, marketing, sales, or operational leadership roles, frame their technology needs primarily in terms of strategic business outcomes and competitive impact.

- ● Revenue Generation &amp; Monetization: BDMs are highly focused on technologies that can directly contribute to top - line growth, enable the launch of new revenue streams, or improve the monetization of existing content assets and audience engagement. 7
- ● Audience Engagement &amp; Customer Experience (CX): Solutions that demonstrably enhance audience engagement, improve the overall customer experience across touchpoints, and build viewer or user loyalty are highly valued. 1 Forrester research indicates that M&amp;E firms consistently prioritize improving CX. 26
- ● Competitive Advantage &amp; Differentiation: BDMs actively seek technologies that can provide a distinct competitive edge, foster innovation in content or service delivery, and differentiate their offerings in an increasingly crowded and fragmented marketplace. 18
- ● Speed to Market &amp; Agility: Technologies that enable faster content creation cycles, quicker launch of new services or features, and overall business agility to respond to market shifts are particularly attractive. 14
- ● Operational Efficiency &amp; Cost Savings (as a means to an end): While cost reduction is a factor, BDMs often view operational efficiency and savings as strategic enablers. The resources freed up can then be reinvested into high - value

areas like content development, talent acquisition, or marketing innovation, rather than solely focusing on bottom-line reduction. 4

- ● Strategic Alignment: BDMs critically assess any proposed technology based on its alignment with the broader business strategy and its direct ability to solve specific, pressing business problems or achieve clearly defined strategic goals. 34
- ● Value Proposition: They are typically less concerned with the granular technical specifications of a solution and more focused on its overall value proposition and the tangible business outcomes it is expected to deliver. 34

A critical pain point that successful B2B tech vendors must actively address is the frequently observed "disconnect between IT and business teams" within M&amp;E organizations. 26 This divergence in priorities and perspectives can lead to stalled decision-making or the selection of technologies that fail to deliver their full potential. Forrester's research explicitly states that repairing this disconnect is vital, as effective cloud decision-making, for example, necessitates a committed, collaborative effort between IT and business units. When technology solutions are perceived to serve only the interests of one group, or when communication breaks down, the buying process falters,  often resulting in post - purchase regret, which Gartner notes occurs in a high percentage of enterprise technology decisions. 34 Therefore, B2B technology vendors should craft messaging, demonstrations, and proposals that explicitly bridge this gap, clearly articulating how technical features translate into tangible business benefits and, conversely, how business objectives can be met through specific technological capabilities. A consultative sales approach that helps facilitate dialogue and build consensus among these diverse internal stakeholders can be a significant differentiator.

## Any new or rising influencers in the buying process

The traditional buying committee is expanding, with new roles gaining significant influence over technology decisions.

- ● Chief Data Officers (CDOs) / Data &amp; Analytics Leaders: As M&amp;E companies increasingly embrace data -driven strategies, CDOs and senior data leaders are becoming pivotal influencers. They champion investments in modern data infrastructure, advanced analytics tools, and AI/ML capabilities that can unlock the value of enterprise data assets. 16
- ● Procurement Leaders: The role of procurement is evolving beyond a purely cost-reduction function. Procurement leaders are increasingly acting as strategic partners in the technology acquisition process, focusing on long - term value,

comprehensive risk management, and fostering strategic supplier relationships. AI is also transforming the procurement function itself, enabling more datadriven sourcing and negotiation. 30  McKinsey notes that procurement leaders have often been "elevated to a position of influence" within their organizations. 38  This shift means that technology proposals will face more rigorous financial and strategic assessment, requiring vendors to provide hard evidence of ROI and risk mitigation.

- ● Heads of Innovation / Transformation Leaders: These roles are specifically tasked with identifying, evaluating, and championing emerging technologies (such as GenAI, Metaverse applications) that have the potential to drive future growth, create new business models, or disrupt existing market dynamics .
- ● ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Leaders: The influence of ESG considerations is growing, particularly concerning the adoption of sustainable technology solutions (e.g., energy -efficient data centers, responsible hardware disposal) and the ethical implications of AI deployment. 30
- ● Legal &amp; Compliance Officers: These stakeholders are crucial in any technology decision that involves handling customer data, managing content rights, adhering to AI ethics guidelines, and ensuring compliance with a complex web of industry -specific and general regulations. 15
- ● Creative Leaders (e.g., Heads of Content, Executive Producers): Creative professionals are becoming more directly involved in technology decisions that impact their workflows and the quality of creative output. This includes evaluating virtual production tools, AI - assisted creation software, and collaborative platform s. 1

## General mindset: innovation - forward, risk - averse, efficiency - led, etc.

The M&amp;E industry often exhibits a complex, sometimes contradictory, mindset when it comes to technology adoption.

- ● A Duality of Innovation and Pragmatism: On one hand, there is a strong intrinsic drive for  innovation . M&amp;E companies constantly seek new ways to create compelling content, deliver unique experiences, and stay ahead of rapid market changes and evolving consumer tastes. 1 On the other hand, significant economic pressures, the high cost of content, and the complexities of technology integration can foster a degree of risk aversion and a sharp focus on efficiency and demonstrable ROI. 6  This creates a "show me, don't just tell me" attitude, especially in established organizations. Technologies perceived as purely experimental, without clear pathways to monetization or tangible

efficiency gains, will struggle to secure budget approval.

## ● Sub-sector Variation:

- ○ Gaming companies and streaming startups often display a more innovation forward and risk -tolerant mindset as they strive to capture market share and disrupt incumbents.
- ○ Established broadcasters and large film studios may be more cautious, carefully balancing the pursuit of innovation with the need to protect existing revenue streams and manage extensive legacy systems, although the external pressure to transform remains immense. 6
- ● Efficiency - Led:  Many technology decisions are fundamentally driven by the need to reduce operational costs (particularly in content production and distribution) and improve overall workflow efficiency. The adoption of AI is a prime example of this efficiency - led approach . 4
- ● Experience -Driven:  A strong counter -current to pure efficiency is the unwavering focus on enhancing audience engagement and the overall customer experience. This can justify investments in more novel or advanced technologies if they promise a significantly improved or uniqu e user journey. 1
- ● Data - Driven:  Increasingly, M&amp;E organizations expect technology investment decisions to be backed by robust data and analytics, moving away from intuition or anecdotal evidence. 10
- ● Partnership - Oriented: There is a growing recognition within the industry that no single company can possess all necessary expertise or resources. This is leading to a greater openness to forming strategic partnerships with technology vendors who can bring specialized capabilit ies and co-innovate. 4

## Regional Nuances in Buyer Mindset

The general mindset of technology buyers can also vary by region.

- ● North America: Buyers in this region are often early adopters of new technologies and operate in a highly competitive environment. There is a strong focus on demonstrable ROI and data -driven decision -making. However, a disconnect between IT and business teams can someti mes present a challenge to smooth adoption. 26
- ● EMEA: Technology adoption can be more conservative in some parts of EMEA, with a particularly strong emphasis on regulatory compliance, especially concerning data privacy (e.g., GDPR heavily influencing data technology choices). However, significant innovation  is also occurring, particularly in areas like local content production and AdTech.
- ● APAC: This is a highly diverse region. Some markets, such as South Korea and Singapore, are known for being highly innovative and digitally advanced. 22 Other markets are in stages of rapid modernization, often leapfrogging older technologies to adopt the latest solutions. A mobile - first mindset is prevalent in many APAC countries. Relationship-based vendor selection often plays a more significant role in  business culture in some parts of this region.

## 4. Messaging and Content Preferences

To effectively connect with B2B technology buyers in the Media &amp; Entertainment sector, vendors must craft messaging and content that resonates with their specific needs, challenges, and communication styles. Understanding their preferences for narrative to nes, content formats, industry language, and common pitfalls is essential.

## Narrative tones and angles that resonate

The tone and angle of marketing communications can significantly impact their reception by M&amp;E buyers.

- ● Value - Driven &amp; Outcome - Focused:  Messaging must clearly and concisely articulate the tangible business value and specific outcomes that the technology solution delivers. This includes quantifying benefits such as increased revenue, improved audience engagement metrics, demonstrable cost savings, or enhanced operational efficiency. 34 Communications firm Red Fan emphasizes the importance of identifying and highlighting value propositions that truly resonate with the target market. 44
- ● Problem/Solution Oriented: Effective narratives clearly identify industry -specific pain points prevalent in the M&amp;E sector (e.g., content fragmentation, declining traditional advertising revenue, workflow bottlenecks, subscriber churn) and then position the technology as a direct a nd effective solution to these challenges. 36
- ● Innovation &amp; Future - Forward (with pragmatism): Highlighting how a technology enables innovation and prepares M&amp;E companies for future industry shifts is appealing. However, this forward - looking perspective must be grounded in practical applications and achievable results, rather than abstract or overl y futuristic claims. 3
- ● Authenticity &amp; Transparency: In an industry often wary of excessive hype, authentic, straightforward, and transparent communication builds crucial trust. This includes being upfront about a solution's potential limitations or specific integration requirements. 5 The M&amp;E industry's own drive for authentic content creation 4 means its professionals are likely to appreciate similar genuineness from B2B vendors. This suggests that a more human -centric and less "corporate -speak" tone, which genuinely addresses industry challenges, will build stronger resonance than traditional,  overly polished marketing.
- ● Partnership &amp; Collaboration: The tone of communications should convey a genuine desire to be a strategic partner rather than merely a transactional vendor. Emphasizing collaboration, shared goals, and a commitment to mutual success is key. 4
- ● Expert &amp; Authoritative (Thought Leadership): Positioning the vendor as a knowledgeable expert with deep insights into M&amp;E industry challenges, trends, and relevant technology solutions builds significant credibility and trust. 47

## Formats and types of proof that influence decisions

M&amp;E buyers rely on various content formats and types of proof to inform their technology purchasing decisions.

- ● Case Studies &amp; Success Stories: Demonstrations of real -world application and

measurable success within other, preferably similar, M&amp;E companies are highly influential and provide tangible proof of a solution's capabilities. 33

- ● ROI Calculators &amp; Business Value Assessments: Quantifiable proof of financial benefits, such as projected ROI, cost savings, or revenue uplift, is crucial, particularly when engaging with BDMs and procurement teams. 34
- ● Product Demonstrations (Customized): Tailored demonstrations that directly address the specific use cases, workflows, and pain points of the M&amp;E prospect are far more effective than generic, one - size- fits - all presentations. 41
- ● Analyst Reports &amp; Third - Party Validation: Reports and evaluations from respected industry analyst firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC lend significant credibility to a vendor's claims and help buyers compare solutions objectively. 12 MainStreaming, for instance, highlights its mention in a Gartner report as a key validator of its market position and innovation. 28
- ● Peer Reviews &amp; Testimonials: Insights, reviews, and testimonials from industry peers, whether through formal channels or informal networks, carry substantial weight due to their perceived objectivity and real - world basis. 33
- ● White Papers &amp; E -books:  In-depth content that explores industry trends, analyzes common challenges, and details technological solutions can be very effective, particularly if it offers unique insights or novel perspectives. 46 Given the rise of GenAI and its capacity to produce "cheap and novel content" 1 , M&amp;E buyers will increasingly value B2B content that showcases deep human expertise, critical thinking, and unique insights that AI alone cannot replicate. Thought leadership that genuinely challenges conventional wisdom or offers provocative, well-researched perspectives will stand out.
- ● Webinars &amp; Virtual Events: These formats are effective for educating prospects, showcasing solutions in action, and facilitating Q&amp;A. Multi - vendor webinars, in particular, can attract a highly targeted audience of interested buyers. 46
- ● Proof of Concepts (PoCs) &amp; Pilot Programs: Offering M&amp;E companies the opportunity to test the technology within their own environment, using their own data and workflows, significantly reduces perceived risk and provides concrete evidence of the solution's value and fit. 25
- ● Visual Content (Videos, Infographics): Visuals are highly effective for explaining complex technological concepts and showcasing benefits in an engaging and easily digestible manner, especially considering that a large portion of the population (around 65%) are visual learners. 47 Explainer videos, animations, and well-designed infographics are particularly useful for breaking down complex

## offerings. 47

The increasing involvement of diverse stakeholders (IT, business, procurement, legal, data) in M&amp;E technology decisions  24  necessitates a multi-faceted content strategy. A single piece of content, however well-crafted, is unlikely to resonate equally with all these varied roles. Vendors must therefore develop a portfolio of content assets specifically tailored to the distinct questions, concerns, and language preferences of each key persona within the buying committee. This might include technical deepdives and integration guides for IT professionals, ROI-focused case studies and TCO models for BDMs and Procurement, and compliance documentation and risk assessments for Legal teams, all while maintaining a consistent core value proposition.

## Common metaphors, language, or frameworks used by buyers

M&amp;E industry professionals frequently use specific terminology, metaphors, and frameworks when discussing their challenges and technology needs. Aligning messaging with this vernacular can improve understanding and rapport.

- ● Common phrases include: "Audience Engagement," "Fan Experience," "Subscriber Lifecycle," "Content is King (but Distribution is Queen/Context is God)."
- ● Operational terms: "Media Supply Chain," "Content Factory," "Workflow Optimization," "Content Velocity."
- ● Strategic concepts: "Personalization at Scale," "Data - Driven Insights," "Monetization Strategies," "Addressable Advertising."
- ● Business models: "Direct -to-Consumer (DTC)," "Over-the-Top (OTT)," "Free AdSupported Streaming TV (FAST)," "Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD)."
- ● Industry dynamics: "Convergence" of media platforms, "Fragmentation" of audiences and attention.
- ● Performance metrics: "Time -to-Market," "Agility," "Scalability," "Churn Rate," "Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)."
- ● Frameworks related to digital transformation journeys, cloud adoption maturity models, and AI implementation stages are also common.

## Common messaging mistakes or overused tropes that fail in this industry

Certain messaging approaches can be counterproductive in the M&amp;E sector.

- ● Feature -Dumping:  Focusing excessively on an exhaustive list of product features without clearly connecting them to specific M&amp;E business benefits, pain

points, or use cases. 5

- ● Generic AI/Cloud Claims: Making vague, unsubstantiated statements about "AI -powered" or "cloud -based" solutions without specifying how these technologies uniquely address M&amp;E challenges or deliver quantifiable, industry - relevant results.
- ● Ignoring Sub - Sector Nuances: Employing a one-size-fits -all message that fails to recognize the diverse needs and priorities of different M&amp;E sub - sectors, such as gaming, news publishing, film production, or live sports.
- ● Tech-Speak &amp; Jargon Overload: Using overly technical language, acronyms, and jargon that may not be understood by BDMs or other less technical influencers within the buying committee. 46
- ● Over -Promising &amp; Under - Delivering: Creating hype or making exaggerated claims about a solution's capabilities or ease of implementation that do not match the reality, leading to disappointment and distrust.
- ● Lack of Understanding of Creative Processes: Messaging that does not demonstrate a genuine appreciation for the creative aspects, artistic integrity, and unique workflows that are central to the M&amp;E industry.
- ● Not Addressing Integration: Failing to clearly articulate how the proposed solution integrates with existing M&amp;E technology stacks and workflows, which is a key concern for ITDMs.
- ● Ignoring Security and Compliance: Downplaying or omitting crucial information about data security measures, IP protection, and adherence to relevant regulatory compliance standards, which are critical concerns for M&amp;E buyers. 24

## Regional Nuances in Messaging

Messaging strategies must also be adapted for regional sensitivities and preferences.

- ● North America: Buyers are generally receptive to data - backed claims, strong ROI arguments, and clear articulation of competitive differentiation. Case studies

featuring well - known North American M&amp;E brands can be particularly impactful.

- ● EMEA: Messaging needs to be sensitive to diverse languages and cultural contexts across the region. A strong emphasis on GDPR compliance and data sovereignty is crucial for any technology handling personal data. Success stories from local European M&amp;E companies  can often be more persuasive than international examples. Building trust and business relationships may play a larger role in the decision -making process.
- ● APAC: This region is highly diverse, necessitating significant localization of messaging and content. A mobile -first approach is key in many APAC markets. Highlighting scalability and support for rapid growth can resonate strongly. A deep understanding of speci fic local market dynamics, such as dominant social commerce trends or the popularity of particular local platforms, is vital. In many Asian cultures, building strong personal relationships (e.g., Guanxi in China) is often a prerequisite for successful busi ness dealings.

## 5. Buying Journey &amp; Channel Behavior

The process by which Media &amp; Entertainment organizations research, evaluate, and purchase B2B technology is multifaceted, involving various stages, information channels, and influential stakeholders. Understanding this journey is key for vendors to align t heir sales and marketing efforts effectively.

## Where and how buyers research, validate, and compare solutions

M&amp;E buyers utilize a range of channels and methods throughout their decision -making process.

- ● Industry Analyst Reports: Publications and advisory services from firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC are frequently consulted to understand market landscapes, assess vendor capabilities, identify industry trends, and see how peers are adopting technologies. 12 These reports often provide structured comparisons and frameworks that influence shortlisting.
- ● Peer Networks &amp; Communities: Informal discussions with industry peers, participation in user groups, and engagement in online forums are highly trusted sources for candid feedback, real - world experiences, and unvarnished opinions on vendors and solutions.
- ● Vendor Websites &amp; Content: These serve as an initial touchpoint for gathering product information, accessing white papers, reviewing case studies, and viewing introductory demonstrations. The quality, relevance, and ease of navigation of vendor-produced content are critical at this stage. 43
- ● Trade Shows &amp; Industry Events: Major industry events (such as NAB Show, IBC, Gamescom, MIPCOM) and more focused regional or niche conferences provide valuable opportunities for discovering new solutions, networking with vendors and peers, seeing live product demonstrations, and compari ng multiple offerings in a concentrated timeframe. 41
- ● Online Search &amp; Digital Publications: General research using search engines (Google, Bing) and reading articles, reviews, and news in industry - specific digital media outlets and trade publications are common early - stage activities.
- ● Software/Data Marketplaces: Cloud provider marketplaces (e.g., AWS Marketplace, Azure Marketplace, Google Cloud Marketplace) are increasingly used by M&amp;E organizations to discover, trial, and procure cloud - based software solutions and data products. 26 Forrester research highlights that these marketplaces can offer stronger CX and provide an efficient way to fill critical capability gaps with specialized toolsets. 26 The increasing reliance on these marketplaces is subtly shifting buyer expectations towards faster deployment, easier trial access, and potentially more transparent, consumption - based pricing models. This trend pressures vendors not listed or those whose direct sales processes seem cumbersome by comparison.
- ● Proof of Concepts (PoCs) / Trials: For complex or mission-critical solutions, hands-on evaluation through PoCs or time -limited trials is a critical step for M&amp;E buyers to assess functionality, integration capabilities, and overall fit within their specific environment. 25
- ● Consultants &amp; System Integrators: External consultants and system integration partners often play a significant advisory role, particularly for large - scale technology implementations. They may assist in defining technology strategy, evaluating vendors, and managing the implementation proc ess.

## Role of analysts, events, partners, or peer networks

Each of these external factors plays a distinct and influential role in the M&amp;E technology buying journey.

- ● Analysts: Industry analysts provide structured frameworks (e.g., Gartner's Magic Quadrant, Forrester Wave ệ ), vendor rankings, market forecasts, and strategic advice that heavily influence how M&amp;E buyers perceive the market and which vendors they shortlist for further evaluation. 48 Analyst reports are often used as objective benchmarks to measure and assess vendor capabilities against specific business needs. 48
- ● Events:  Industry events are crucial for discovery, allowing buyers to encounter

new vendors and technologies. They also offer opportunities for hands - on experience through demos and facilitate high-level networking with vendor executives and industry peers.

- ● Partners (Technology &amp; Channel): Strategic alliances between technology vendors, pre-built integrations with existing M&amp;E technology stacks, and recommendations from trusted implementation partners or resellers can significantly sway purchasing decisions. 4 Forrester specifically recommends that M&amp;E firms leverage partner networks to fill in key capability gaps. 26
- ● Peer Networks: These are highly influential due to the perceived objectivity and relevance of the information shared. Buyers trust insights from peers who have firsthand experience with a vendor or solution, using these networks to validate vendor claims and understand  potential challenges or best practices.

## Common sales cycle patterns: fast/slow, consensus - driven, RFP-heavy, etc.

Sales cycles for B2B technology in the M&amp;E sector exhibit several common patterns.

- ● Generally Slow &amp; Complex for Enterprise Solutions: The procurement of enterprise -grade software and complex technology solutions in the M&amp;E industry typically involves lengthy sales cycles. These can often range from several months to over a year, primarily due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders, rigorous technical and business evaluation processes, formal procurement procedures, and often, the need for solution customization or complex integration [ 36 (drawing parallels from complex B2B sales in manufacturing), 41 ].
- ● Consensus -Driven:  Technology decisions in M&amp;E organizations frequently require buy -in from a diverse group of stakeholders across multiple departments, including IT, various business units (creative, marketing, operations), finance, legal, and procurement. 26 Building consensus among these groups, each with potentially different priorities and concerns, is a critical and often time -consuming aspect of the sales cycle. Gartner research indicating that 80% of enterprise technology decisions result in post - purchase regret often points to a lack of initial consensus or unclear goals. 34 This high rate of regret suggests a significant gap between vendor promises and buyer realities, or fundamental flaws in the buying process itself. For M&amp;E, where technology choices directly impact creative output and core business models, this regret can be particularly damaging.
- ● RFP-Heavy (for larger deals): Formal Request for Proposal (RFP) processes are common practice for significant technology investments, especially when dealing with larger, more traditional M&amp;E organizations or publicly funded broadcasters.
- ● Relationship - Intensive: Building strong, trust -based relationships with key stakeholders across the target M&amp;E organization is vital for successfully navigating complex and often lengthy sales cycles. 41
- ● Value and Solution Selling Approach: M&amp;E buyers typically expect a consultative selling approach. They value vendors who demonstrate a deep understanding of their specific industry challenges and can tailor solutions accordingly, rather than simply pitching generic products or features. 41
- ● Shorter Cycles for SaaS/Marketplace Purchases: In contrast, smaller, more standardized Software -as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions or tools acquired via cloud marketplaces may experience faster, more transactional sales cycles. These purchases are often driven by specific departmental needs and may involve fewer decision -makers.

The combination of typically lengthy sales cycles 41 and the critical need for consensus among diverse internal stakeholders 26 means that "educating the committee" becomes a core go - to - market activity for technology vendors. This requires a continuous stream of tailored information and engagement that helps different stakeholders understand the solution's value proposition from t heir unique perspectives, thereby facilitating internal alignment and decision progression.

## Where in the journey decisions stall or accelerate

Understanding the common friction points and accelerators in the M&amp;E buying journey can help vendors proactively address challenges and leverage opportunities.

## ● Stall Points:

- ○ Lack of Clear ROI / Business Case: Decisions often stall if the value proposition is not compelling or if the anticipated ROI is not clearly and quantifiably demonstrated. 34
- ○ Budget Constraints / Re -prioritization:  Unforeseen budget cuts, shifts in organizational priorities, or economic uncertainty can halt or delay technology investments. 24
- ○ Integration Complexity &amp; Risk:  Significant concerns about the difficulty, cost, or risk of integrating a new solution with existing legacy systems or workflows can cause hesitation. 26
- ○ Lack of Internal Consensus:  Disagreements or lack of alignment between IT, various business units, and other key stakeholders is a major cause of stalled decisions. 26
- ○ Security or Compliance Concerns:  If a proposed solution fails to meet the
- M&amp;E organization's stringent security standards or regulatory compliance requirements, it will likely be rejected or significantly delayed. 41
- ○ No Internal Champion:  The absence of a strong, influential advocate within the M&amp;E organization to champion the purchase and navigate internal hurdles can lead to inertia.
- ○ Vendor Instability Concerns:  Doubts about the vendor's long - term financial stability, ability to deliver on promises, or capacity to provide ongoing support can undermine buyer confidence. 33

## ● Acceleration Points:

- ○ Strong, Quantifiable ROI:  A clear, data-backed demonstration of how the solution will lead to significant cost savings, generate new revenue, or substantially improve operational efficiency can greatly accelerate decisions. 34
- ○ Executive Sponsorship / Internal Champion:  The active support of a senior leader within the M&amp;E organization who champions the solution and helps overcome internal obstacles is a powerful accelerator.
- ○ Successful PoC / Pilot Program:  A positive and conclusive trial or pilot program that clearly demonstrates the technology's value, ease of use, and fit within the M&amp;E company's specific environment can build strong momentum.
- ○ Alignment with Strategic Imperatives: If the technology solution directly supports a critical, high -priority business initiative (e.g., launching a new flagship DTC service, expanding into a key international market, overhauling a core production process).
- ○ Positive Peer References / Strong Analyst Validation:  Endorsements from trusted industry peers or favorable evaluations from respected analyst firms can significantly boost buyer confidence and speed up the decision.
- ○ Ease of Integration / Low Disruption: Solutions that are perceived as relatively easy to implement and integrate, with minimal disruption to existing operations and workflows, are more likely to gain quick approval.
- ○ Competitive Pressure:  An urgent need to adopt a particular technology to keep pace with, or gain an advantage over, key competitors can create a strong impetus for rapid decision - making.

## Regional Nuances in Buying Journey

The buying journey itself can also exhibit regional variations.

- ● North America: For large enterprises, the process is often RFP -driven. There's a

high reliance on analyst reports and peer reviews for validation. Sales cycles can be highly competitive, requiring vendors to clearly articulate strong differentiation.

- ● EMEA: Relationship-building is often more critical and may require a longer timeframe. Decision -making processes can be more hierarchical in some countries, while more consensus -driven in others. Local presence, language support, and an understanding of specifi c cultural business etiquette are important. Navigating diverse regulatory landscapes on a country - by- country basis (e.g., data protection, broadcast regulations) adds complexity to the sales cycle.
- ● APAC: This is a highly diverse region. In markets like Japan, the process of internal consensus -building (nemawashi) is crucial and can significantly lengthen sales cycles. In other APAC markets, decisions might be made more quickly, especially if driven by top  leadership. Local partnerships and a nuanced understanding of specific business etiquette and cultural norms are key to success. Go-to-market strategies need to be highly localized to account for these variations. 50

## 6. Strategic Insights for Marketers

For B2B technology marketers aiming to successfully penetrate and thrive within the Media &amp; Entertainment sector, a nuanced and adaptive approach is essential. The following strategic imperatives, derived from the preceding analysis, can guide more effecti ve engagement and drive better business outcomes.

## Three key things marketers should remember when targeting this industry

- ● 1. Embrace Value -Centric Storytelling Tailored to Sub - Sector Nuances: M&amp;E buyers, spanning roles from IT leadership to business unit heads, are fundamentally driven by the imperative to achieve specific, measurable outcomes. These outcomes can range from enhancing audience engagement and streamlining complex creative workflo ws to unlocking new monetization opportunities and improving content ROI.26 It is therefore critical for marketers to move beyond mere feature lists and instead articulate a clear, compelling value proposition. This proposition must be meticulously tailore d to resonate with the unique challenges, operational realities, and strategic goals of distinct M&amp;E sub-sectors-recognizing, for instance, that the priorities of a gaming company differ vastly from those of a news publisher or a live sports broadcaster. A s Deloitte's research underscores, understanding the evolving consumer expectations, which are increasingly shaped by the immediacy of social media and the immersive nature of gaming, is crucial for framing relevant value.1 Alex Holtz, Research Director at IDC, aptly captures this sentiment: "It is no longer about should customers adopt cloud services but rather how fast can they deploy solutions to drive more business as competition heats up...".12 This quote emphasizes the need for messaging that focuses on speed to market, tangible business impact, and the ability to confer a competitive advantage in a fast -moving industry.
- ● 2. Build Trust Through Authenticity, Expertise, and Demonstrable Proof: The M&amp;E industry, with its inherent creativity and exposure to various hype cycles, values authenticity and is often skeptical of unsubstantiated claims.5 Marketers must prioritize building credibility and trust through genuine thought leadership that demo nstrates a deep understanding of the sector's intricacies.47 Transparent communication, even about potential solution limitations or integration complexities, is valued. Most importantly, claims must be backed by robust and relevant proof points. These inc lude M&amp;E-specific case studies detailing real -world successes, data -backed ROI analyses, positive evaluations from respected industry analysts, and credible peer testimonials.43 The prevailing "show me, don't just tell me" mindset within M&amp;E necessitates t angible evidence of a solution's efficacy and impact.

Deloitte's 2025 Digital Media Trends report highlights how social media creators effectively build trust through authenticity, offering a valuable lesson for B2B marketers targeting the M&amp;E space: "Social content creators can be the strongest advocates...  They can help you engage audiences and communicate with them with greater authenticity.".4 This suggests that B2B brands can also benefit from adopting a more genuine, less overtly "salesy" communication style.

- ● 3. Navigate the Complex Buying Committee with Persona -Driven Engagement: Technology purchasing decisions within M&amp;E organizations typically involve a diverse and expanding group of stakeholders. This committee often includes representatives from IT, various business units (such as content, marketing, and operations), procuremen t, and increasingly, specialized leaders from data, legal, and compliance teams.24 These stakeholders frequently have differing priorities, perspectives, and evaluation criteria, which can lead to what Forrester identifies as a potential "disconnect betwee n IT and business teams".26 Marketers must develop sophisticated engagement strategies and a varied portfolio of content assets that address the specific needs, questions, and concerns of each key persona within this buying committee. The goal is to provid e each stakeholder with the information they need to see value from their perspective, thereby facilitating internal consensus and smoother decision - making. Forrester's study on M&amp;E cloud solutions underscores this point, finding that aligning IT and business priorities is critical for success. Failure to achieve this alignment "will lead to a lack of business model scalability, rising costs, a lack of available resources, an increase in cloud vulnerabilities, and weaker cloud effectiveness across the organization".26 This highlights the marketer's role in

helping to bridge these internal divides through targeted communication.

The rapid and pervasive adoption of AI, particularly GenAI, for core creative and operational tasks within the M&amp;E industry  1 , combined with the inherent "black box" nature of some advanced AI models, creates a critical imperative for technology marketers. Messaging around AI solutions must proactively emphasize transparency, explainability, and user control. M&amp;E buyers, while eager to harness AI's benefits, will be justifiably wary of solutions that appear to cede too much creative or strategic control without clear oversight mechanisms or the ability to intervene. Creative integrity and brand consistency are paramount in this sector, and there are inherent risks associated with AI generating content that could be off-brand, biased, or inadvertently infringe on intellectual property. 1  Therefore, marketers for AI technology vendors need to go beyond highlighting capabilities and proactively address these concerns by showcasing features related to AI explainability, user control over outputs, embedded ethical safeguards, and the ability to customize AI models to align with specific brand guidelines and creative visions. "Trustworthy AI" and "Responsible AI" are not just buzzwords but will become powerful selling points.

Furthermore, the ongoing convergence of media formats (streaming, gaming, social media)  1 and the intensified focus on building direct audience relationships through DTC models  12  carry significant implications for technology solutions. Successful B2B offerings will increasingly be those that can effectively break down data silos and enable a holistic, 360 -degree view of the customer journey across these converging touchpoints. Legacy technology stacks within M&amp;E companies often feature data siloed by channel or function, making it difficult to gain a unified understanding of audience behavior, personalize experiences effectively across platforms, or accurately measure the true impact of content and marketing initiatives. Consequently, B2B technology vendors whose solutions facilitate seamless data integration, offer open APIs for interoperability, and enable sophisticated crosschannel analytics will be highly valued. Marketers should prominently feature these capabilities, emphasizing how their platforms help M&amp;E companies connect the dots in an increasingly fragmented and interconnected ecosystem.

Finally, the significant M&amp;A activity and the broader trend towards consolidation within the M&amp;E sector  6  present both opportunities and challenges for technology vendors. When M&amp;E companies merge or are acquired, they often inherit disparate and sometimes incompatible technology stacks. This frequently leads to complex integration projects and a thorough re-evaluation of existing vendor contracts and overarching technology roadmaps. This dynamic creates openings for vendors whose solutions can simplify post-merger technology integration, offer scalable platforms suitable for the newly combined entity, or provide distinct strategic advantages in the altered competitive landscape. However, it also introduces risks if a vendor's solution is deemed redundant, incompatible with the acquiring company's preferred technology stack, or not aligned with the new entity's strategic direction. Marketers in this space must therefore remain agile, closely tracking industry shifts and M&amp;A developments. They need to be prepared to adapt their messaging quickly to address the specific challenges and opportunities arising from such consolidations, for example, by highlighting how their platform "simplifies post-merger tech integration" or enables the new entity to "scale combined operations seamlessly."

## Common pitfalls to avoid when adapting messaging from other sectors

When adapting marketing strategies from other industries to the M&amp;E sector, several common pitfalls can undermine effectiveness:

- ● Assuming Homogeneity: Treating the diverse M&amp;E sector as a monolithic entity. The technological needs, business drivers, and cultural nuances of a film studio are vastly different from those of a gaming company, a news publisher, a music label, or a live sports broadcaster. Ge neric messaging that fails to acknowledge these sub-sector specificities will inevitably fall flat.
- ● Underestimating the Creative Element: Crafting messaging that is purely technical or focused solely on operational efficiency, without acknowledging or respecting the central role of creative drivers, artistic integrity, and unique workflows in the M&amp;E industry, will fail to connect with key decision-makers and users.
- ● Overlooking the Speed of Change: The M&amp;E industry is characterized by rapid evolution in technology, consumer behavior, and business models. Messaging that reflects outdated trends, uses obsolete terminology, or fails to acknowledge emerging forces (such as the profound impact of GenAI o r the rise of the creator economy) will quickly seem irrelevant and out of touch.
- ● Ignoring the Influence of End - User Experience: Even in B2B sales to M&amp;E companies, the ultimate impact of a technology solution on the consumer or audience experience is a critical consideration for buyers. Messaging should endeavor to connect the benefits of B2B solutions to tangible B2C outcomes, such as improved viewer engagement, enhanced fan experiences, or more compelling content.
- ● Misunderstanding Regulatory &amp; Rights Complexity: Failing to address, or demonstrate a clear understanding of, the complex landscape of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), content rights management, music licensing, and
- other M&amp;E - s p e c ific  re gula tory and compliance requirements can be a significant oversight and a potential deal-breaker.
- ● Tech for Tech's Sake: Pitching technology features or capabilities without a clear and compelling link to solving a specific M&amp;E business problem or achieving a tangible, measurable business outcome. As consultant Geoffrey Moore famously stated (in a general business context, but highly applicable here), "Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway" . 10 M&amp;E buyers need to see precisely how a technology solution will help them navigate their specific "freeway" of industry challenges and opportunities.

By internalizing these strategic considerations and avoiding common missteps, B2B technology marketers can significantly improve their ability to resonate with, engage, and ultimately partner successfully with organizations in the dynamic Media &amp; Entertainment sector. The industry's ongoing transformation, driven by technological innovation and shifting consumer preferences, presents fertile ground for vendors who can demonstrate genuine understanding, deliver clear value, and build trusted partnerships.
