## Navigating the Evolving Landscape: B2B Technology Buyer Behavior in Global Financial Services

## 1. Industry Context

The global financial services industry, encompassing banking, insurance, and capital markets, is undergoing a period of profound transformation. This evolution is driven by a confluence of major technological advancements, shifting economic forces, and heightened regulatory pressures. Understanding this context is crucial for B2B technology providers aiming to effectively engage buyers within this complex sector.

## Major trends, economic forces, and transformation drivers

Several overarching trends are shaping the financial services landscape and influencing technology adoption:

- ● The Ascendancy of Generative AI (GenAI): The rapid emergence and adoption of GenAI is arguably the most significant transformation driver. Accenture identifies GenAI as the "#1 trend for banks in 2024," predicting it will fundamentally change "how banking does it," potentially boosting productiv ity by 20-30% and revenues by 6%. 1  McKinsey's 2024 global survey on AI reveals that 65% of organizations are already regularly using GenAI. 3 Deloitte echoes this, noting that "technological turbulence," including GenAI, will necessitate unprecedented agility from financial services leaders, suggesting that 2024 could be "the year the future started to unfold". 5 This is not merely the adoption of a new tool but a fundamental reshaping of operational models, customer engagement strategies, and product development cycles, creating an urgent and substantial demand for AI -related solutions and specialized expertise.
- ● Economic Uncertainty and the Pursuit of Resilience: Lingering fears of recession from 2023 7 and persistent economic headwinds 8 are compelling financial institutions to prioritize operational efficiencies while simultaneously investing in future growth and resilience. Despite market turmoil, IDC projects that IT spending in the banking sector will grow by 8.8% annually through 202 6. 7 This dual pressure means buyers are actively seeking technology solutions that offer a clear return on investment (ROI), enhance efficiency, and bolster their capacity to navigate economic volatility.
- ● Accelerated Digital Transformation: The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for digital initiatives, and this momentum shows no signs of abating. Financial institutions are moving beyond foundational digital services towards

more sophisticated, AI - driven personalization and enriched customer interactions. 1 For instance, banking customers increasingly expect to accomplish any financial task through a mobile app and value connected experiences blending human and digital elements. 9  Insurance CIOs, recognizing a comparative lack of digital maturity in their sector, are actively rethinking their digital strategies. 10 This sustained drive fuels continuous demand for technologies supporting advanced digital capabilities, from customer experience platforms and data analytics to robust cloud infrastructure.

## ● Geo-Specific Economic and Policy Drivers:

- ○ North America (NA): This region, particularly the US, leads global tech spending and AI software adoption, with financial services and insurance being significant contributors to growth. 11 US tech spend (excluding staffing) is projected to exceed $2 trillion in 2025, with 63% driven by sectors including financial services and insurance. 11 Key drivers include balancing fintech integration with legacy infrastructure and adapting to new regulations like T+1 settlement in capital markets and heightened scrutiny on bank mergers. 8
- ○ Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA): Tech expenditure in Europe is driven by investments in cloud, security, GenAI, and the broader digital economy, with financial services accounting for over 40% of this spend. 11 European tech spend is expected to grow by 5% in 2025. 11 Regulatory frameworks like PSD2, GDPR, and open banking initiatives are major influencers 16 , alongside the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for ESG disclosures. 8  Geopolitical factors are accelerating investment 1 in emerging technologies, with EU and UK initiatives aiming for AI leadership. 16 Trust levels in banks can be lower in some European countries compared to the US, with dependability and empathy being key areas for improvement. 20
- ○ Asia Pacific (APAC): The region is experiencing robust tech spending, fueled by strong real GDP growth in nations like India, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia, complemented by government -led digitalization initiatives in China and India. 11 Forrester initially projected APAC tech spending to grow 6.5% in 2025. 21 India, in particular, is forecast to see tech spend increase by 9.6% in 2025. 11 However, the introduction of broad US tariffs is expected to increase technology costs and potentially dampen this optimistic outlook by 1 - 2 percentage points. 21 Despite this, adoption of AI and cloud will continue rapidly. 21 High mobile-first innovation is a characteristic, but trust gaps can exist. 24 Regulatory complexity is increasing, with a focus on risk management and cybersecurity. 21

The interplay between AI and human capabilities is emerging as a core transformation driver. It's not just about AI adoption in isolation, but how AI interacts with, augments, and enhances human skills and the customer experience. 1  Accenture's concept of "human by design" technology  29  and the banking sector's focus on "humanlike" digital experiences  9 or fostering "meaningful conversations"  1  point to this profound shift. BCG's finding that 70 % of AI effort should be dedicated to "business and people transformation" reinforces the idea that technology buyers are seeking solutions that facilitate a new paradigm of work and interaction, blending human expertise with AI-driven efficiency and insight. 27  This has significant implications for product design, user interface development, and the change management services offered by technology vendors.

## Common business models and how they shape buying behavior

While the provided research doesn't extensively detail the business models financial services firms use when selling to their customers, it offers insights into how they procure  technology. The widespread move to cloud platforms 1 strongly implies an increasing adoption of subscription - based models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) for technology consumption.

The consistent emphasis on crafting compelling "value stories" 36 and demonstrating clear ROI  39 suggests that financial services buyers meticulously scrutinize the total cost of ownership and the flexibility of vendor engagement models. In an environment marked by economic uncertainty, they are likely to favor solutions that offer scalability and pr edictable cost structures.

Furthermore, the rise of embedded finance -where financial services are integrated into non -financial offerings -is reshaping business models towards platform - based ecosystems. 5  This trend is likely to drive demand for technologies that support API -driven architectures, seamless integrations, and robust partnership capabilities. Technology vendors, therefore, need to offer flexible consumption models that align with the financial  prudence and scalability requirements of these institutions.

## Regulatory or compliance pressures affecting technology decisions

Regulatory and compliance pressures are significant factors shaping technology decisions across the financial services industry globally.

- ● Intensified Scrutiny on Artificial Intelligence: The rapid adoption of AI, especially GenAI, is attracting significant regulatory attention. Concerns revolve

around data privacy, potential biases in algorithms, the transparency of AI - driven decisions, and the overall accuracy and reliability of these systems. 27  For instance, Colorado's AI regulation for the insurance sector is seen as a potential precedent for other jurisdictions. 27  Regulators are also becoming more sophisticated in their use of data and surveillance techniques. 8  This means technology buyers are actively seeking solutions with embedded governance features, explainability, and robust compliance frameworks for AI.

- ● Cybersecurity and Data Protection: Given the increasing volume and sophistication of cyberattacks, particularly those leveraging AI, cybersecurity remains a paramount concern and a top investment priority. 5 Adherence to data privacy regulations, such as GDPR in Europe  17 , continues to be critical. For technology buyers, robust security is a non - negotiable baseline criterion.
- ● Operational Resilience: Regulators globally are focused on ensuring that financial institutions can withstand operational disruptions, whether from cyber incidents, technological failures, or other external shocks. 7 This drives investment in resilient infrastructure, disaster recovery capabilities, and business continuity solutions.
- ● Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Reporting and Compliance: ESG considerations are increasingly influencing technology decisions, particularly for data management, reporting, and compliance. 41 IDC highlights the growing need for a dedicated "sustainability tech stack" to manage these requirements. 46 This translates to a growing demand for technologies that help firms manage, report on, and improve their ESG performance.
- ● Geo-Specific Regulatory Nuances:
- ○ North America (NA): Recent regulatory changes include new rules for T+1 settlement in capital markets 8 and heightened scrutiny on bank mergers and acquisitions. 13
- ○ Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA): Key areas of focus include AI regulation (e.g., eIDAS 2, GDPR compliance with AI use cases  7 ) and 1 Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) compliance for ESG disclosures. 18 Open banking frameworks like PSD2 also significantly shape the technology landscape. 16
- ○ Asia Pacific (APAC): The region is characterized by increasingly proactive regulatory frameworks for risk management and cybersecurity. 24 Growing regulatory complexity is also driving demand for specialized IT services. 21

Regulatory scrutiny acts as both a direct driver for certain technology investments (e.g., GRC tools, cybersecurity solutions 7 ) and a critical modulator for the adoption of new technologies like AI. 8 The apprehension regarding non-compliance or future regulatory shifts can temper the pace of adoption or steer it towards solutions that offer strong, demonstrable governance capabilities. The emphasis on "responsible AI" 45 and building "trust"  28 is a direct consequence of these pressures. Consequently, technology buyers will show a strong preference for vendors who not only provide cutting-edge technology but also exhibit a profound understanding of the intricate regulatory landscape, offering tools and frameworks that facilitate compliant adoption. This creates a significant opportunity for vendors who can position themselves as strategic partners in navigating regulatory complexity.

## Key sub -sectors within this industry, and how buyer behavior may differ across them

While common themes like AI adoption, digital transformation, and regulatory compliance span the entire financial services industry, buyer behavior and specific technology priorities exhibit notable differences across its key sub - sectors: banking, insurance, and capital markets.

## ● Banking:

- ○ Priorities:  A primary focus for banks is enhancing the digital customer experience (CX) to be more "humanlike, connected, and empowering". 9 This involves leveraging GenAI for more natural customer interactions, personalized financial advice, and dynamic pricing strategies. 1 Modernizing aging core banking systems is another critical priority to improve agility and reduce operational risk. 1 Ensuring profitable outcomes from extensive digital strategy investments is a key concern for banking CIOs. 10 The exploration and integration of embedded finance solutions is also gaining traction. 5

- ○ Buyer Behavior Drivers: Banks are driven by the need to recapture the "digital dividend" by fostering more meaningful and loyal customer relationships beyond transactional efficiency. 1 They are also compelled to address emerging financial risks, such as potential mortgage defaults and exposure in

the commercial real estate sector. 1 Improving operational efficiency through AI and cloud adoption remains a constant driver. 1  Leaders in digital banking maturity are distinguished by their focus on personalized customer experiences and achieving operational efficiencies through technology. 26

## ● Insurance:

- ○ Priorities:  Insurers are keenly focused on leveraging AI to transform core processes. This includes AI in underwriting for significant efficiency gains (Accenture suggests up to 36%) and improved loss ratios 34 , AI in claims processing for substantial cost reductions (up to 50%) and faster settlement times  34 , and AI in customer service for productivity improvements exceeding 30%. 34  A major challenge is addressing the impacts of social inflation and the evolving landscape of cyber risks. 27 Compared to banking, the insurance sector is often perceived as being less mature in its overall digital journey, prompting CIOs to rethink their digital strategies. 10

## ■ Regional Nuances:

- ■ NA: Dealing with the impacts of social inflation and "nuclear verdicts" on claims costs. 27
- ■ EMEA: Adapting to evolving AI regulations (like Colorado's, potentially influencing EU approaches) and data privacy rules (GDPR) in underwriting and claims. 16
- ■ APAC: Focus on digital distribution channels and leveraging AI for risk assessment in diverse and rapidly growing markets. 24
- ○ Buyer Behavior Drivers: The need to adapt underwriting practices and risk assessment models to counter social inflation and sophisticated cyber threats is a primary driver for technology investment. 27 Insurers are looking to enhance operational efficiency and decision - making accuracy with GenAI, while carefully managing the associated ethical considerations and data privacy concerns. 27 Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape around AI is also a key factor influencing technology choices. 27 M&amp;A activity in insurance is often characterized by divestitures aimed at sharpening business focus and shedding non -core assets. 14

## ● Capital Markets:

- ○ Priorities:  Merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity is a significant feature, often driven by the need for scale and enhanced capabilities, particularly in technology and data infrastructure. 14 Infrastructure players within capital markets are actively seeking to expand their data and technology offerings. There is a strong push to adopt AI for trading algorithms, advanced risk

14

management, and automated compliance monitoring. 8 The exploration and adoption of asset tokenization and digital assets are gaining momentum as firms seek new efficiencies and revenue streams. 14  In the US market, firms are also focused on preparing for the transition to T+1 settlement cycles. 8

- ■ APAC: Growth in digital asset trading platforms and cross - border investment flows influencing technology needs. 24
- ○ Buyer Behavior Drivers: The dynamic nature of capital markets necessitates adaptation through M&amp;A to gain competitive advantages. 14 Enhancing data analytics capabilities and modernizing technology infrastructure are crucial for maintaining an edge. 14 Managing evolving regulatory requirements, such as new settlement rules, is a key operational driver. 8 Firms are also actively exploring new revenue opportunities presented by digital assets and the application of AI in various aspects of their operations. 14

While all financial services sub -sectors are prioritizing investments in AI, cloud, and data analytics, the specific applications and the urgency of adoption vary. Banking places a heavy emphasis on customer -facing AI applications 1 , while insurance leverages AI for core risk assessment and processing functions like underwriting and claims. 34 Capital markets firms utilize technology extensively for M&amp;A enablement, enhancing data capabilities, and modernizing market infrastructure. 14 However, overarching trends such as the rise of embedded finance 5 and the increasing need for holistic, enterprise - wide risk management  1  indicate areas of potential convergence where technology solutions might span across these traditional sub -sector boundaries. This necessitates nuanced go - to - market strategies from technology vendors. While some platform technologies may have broad applic ability, specific use cases, messaging, and proof points must be meticulously tailored to the unique operational realities and strategic objectives of banking, insurance, and capital markets entities, considering regional variations in regulation, market m aturity, and customer trust. There is also a growing opportunity for solutions that can bridge existing gaps or facilitate collaboration across these increasingly interconnected areas.

## 2. Technology Investment Priorities

Financial services institutions globally are making significant technology investments to navigate the evolving industry landscape, meet customer expectations, and adhere to regulatory demands. These investments span modernizing legacy systems, optimizing existing processes, and exploring disruptive emerging technologies. Regional priorities may differ based on economic conditions, regulatory landscapes, and market maturity.

## Top IT and business -led technology investment areas

Several key technology areas are consistently cited as top priorities for both IT and business leaders within financial services:

- ● Generative AI (GenAI) &amp; Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML):
- This is universally recognized as a paramount investment area. Forrester projects that GenAI, alongside cybersecurity and cloud solutions, will be a primary driver of the anticipated 5.6% growth in global technology spending in 2025. 11 IDC identifies AI/ML/GenAI as a dominant trend propelling technology investments in the financial services sector throughout 2024. 41 Accenture research suggests that banks implementing GenAI could see productivity increases of 20 - 30% and revenue growth of up to 6%. 1 Corroborating this, Gartner's 2024 CIO survey lists AI/ML as the fourth highest IT investment priority. 45 A 2024 Deloitte survey found that 86% of financial services respondents were investing in AI, with 62% specifically investing in GenAI. 39
- ○ Regional Focus: North America leads in AI software spend. 11 APAC shows rapid AI adoption, particularly in India and for enhancing digital infrastructure. 11 EMEA is also strongly investing in AI, driven by digital economy initiatives and specific regulations like eIDAS 2. 11
- ● Cybersecurity: Due to the escalating sophistication of threats and an intensified regulatory focus, cybersecurity remains a consistent top - tier investment. 5 Forrester highlights cybersecurity as a key factor fueling spending on software and IT services. 11 In Gartner's CIO survey, cybersecurity ranked as the number one IT investment priority. 45
- ○ Regional Focus: A high priority across all regions due to increasing cyberattacks and stringent data protection laws (e.g., GDPR in EMEA 17 ). APAC has a growing focus on cybersecurity to manage increasing regulatory complexity and enhance threat detection. 21
- ● Cloud Platforms: Cloud adoption is fundamental for achieving agility, enabling advanced data capabilities, and powering AI initiatives. 1 Accenture observes a shift in banking towards "cloud - first" strategic thinking. 1 IDC data indicates that

spending on cloud solutions in the banking sector is growing at a faster rate than overall IT expenditure. 7 Cloud platforms were ranked as the third highest priority in Gartner's CIO survey. 45

- ○ Regional Focus: Strong adoption globally. APAC sees rapid cloud adoption fueling software and IT services growth. 11 EMEA investments are significant in cloud for the digital economy. 11 NA continues to lead in cloud computing adoption. 11
- ● Data Analytics / Business Intelligence: The ability to derive actionable insights from vast datasets is crucial for personalization, effective risk management, and as a foundational element for successful AI deployment. 7 This area was the second highest investment priority identified in Gartner's CIO survey. 45
- ○ Regional Focus: Universally important. APAC banks are investing heavily in BDA and AI-powered solutions for decision - making and hyperpersonalization. 24
- ● Application Modernization: Financial institutions are actively overhauling legacy applications to enhance agility, improve performance, and reduce accumulated technical debt. 11 This was listed as the fifth top IT investment priority in Gartner's CIO survey. 45 This focus creates significant opportunities for vendors offering services and tools that facilitate application modernization, including migration to new architectural paradigms and automated code conversion, such as leveraging AI for transforming legacy  COBOL code. 1
- ○ Regional Focus: A key challenge in NA due to extensive legacy systems. 8 APAC has aggressive modernization agendas in countries like India and Vietnam. 11

The symbiotic relationship between AI, cloud, and data modernization is evident. Investment in GenAI is not an isolated endeavor; its success is intrinsically linked to effective cloud utilization 1 and the availability of robust, well - governed data capabilities. 1 The "lack of a strong cloud infrastructure" is cited as a primary challenge for GenAI implementation 44 , and comprehensive "data modernization" is considered essential for successful AI and GenAI adoption. 58 This interdependency means buyers are increasingly seeking integrated solutions or clear, well - defined pathways to connect these critical domains. A standalone AI offering without a coherent cloud strategy or a demonstrable data readiness plan will likely be perceived as incomplete and less attractive. This environment creates opportunities for vendors who can offer end-to-end solutions or cultivate strong partnership ecosystems to deliver comprehensive value.

## Patterns of modernization vs. optimization

Financial services firms are navigating a balance between comprehensive modernization of core systems and targeted optimization of existing processes.

- ● Modernization: There is a strong emphasis on modernizing core systems, particularly within the banking sector, often referred to as tackling "the key to the core"  , alongside broader application modernization efforts. 1 45 This includes strategic initiatives to migrate critical core platforms to cloud environments 7 and leveraging innovative technologies like GenAI to convert outdated code, thereby freeing banks from the limitations imposed by aging legacy systems. 1
- ● Optimization: AI and automation are being heavily utilized for process optimization across the enterprise. This includes IT and business process automation aimed at increasing operational efficiency. 7 GenAI, in particular, is viewed as a technology that can enable operational improvements that go "Beyond Six Sigma," offering new paradigms for enhancing efficiency. 1
- ● The Balancing Act: Forrester advises that companies must "balance their rapid tech investments with ongoing efforts to manage legacy systems and reduce technical debt". 11 Similarly, Deloitte highlights that CIOs are strategically re -evaluating their core technology stack, not through piecemeal changes, but based on a holistic assessment of what truly delivers business value. 60

This indicates that modernization is increasingly viewed as an "intelligent transformation" rather than a simple "rip and replace" strategy. While legacy systems represent a significant pain point 1 , the approach to addressing them is becoming more nuanced and strategic. The use of GenAI to convert old code 1 and to accelerate the reduction of technical debt 57 suggests a pathway to modernization that is less disruptive and more intelligently integrated. Accenture's observation of a "shift from technology management to an engineering mindset" 1 further points to a more strategic, value -driven evolution of technology stacks, rather than wholesale replacements undertaken without clear business outcome alignment. Technology vendors should therefore position their modernization solutions not merely on technical superiority, but on their ability to intelligently transform existing systems, minimize disruption, and unlock specific business value tied to the institution's strategic goals. 39

## Infrastructure limitations or legacy constraints

Several significant infrastructure limitations and legacy constraints continue to challenge financial services institutions:

- ● Aging Core Systems: This is a particularly acute problem for banks, many of which operate on systems with "millions of lines of outdated, poorly documented, and difficult - to- change COBOL code". 1  These legacy cores hinder agility, slow down innovation, and increase operational risk. This is a notable constraint in North America. 8
- ● Technical Debt: Accumulated technical debt can consume a substantial portion of technology budgets (estimated at 20 - 40%), significantly impeding the pace of new development and innovation. 57 GenAI is being actively explored as a means to accelerate the reduction of this debt. 57
- ● Data Silos:  The persistence of data silos across organizations prevents an enterprise -wide view of data, hindering effective data analytics and the successful implementation of AI initiatives. 45 Data modernization services are often focused on breaking down these silos and creating unified data platforms.

58

- ● Lack of Strong Cloud Infrastructure: C-suite leaders have identified the absence of a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure as the top challenge when implementing GenAI solutions. 44

These limitations create direct and pressing needs for modernization services, new platform deployments, advanced data integration tools, and comprehensive cloud infrastructure solutions. Vendors who can effectively address these deep - seated pain points and offer clear pathways to overcome them possess a strong and compelling value proposition.

## Emerging technologies being evaluated or piloted

Beyond established priorities, financial services firms, particularly "pioneer" organizations, are actively evaluating and piloting a range of emerging technologies with potentially transformative impact:

- ● Agentic AI / AI Agents: BCG views agentic AI as a technology with game changing potential, anticipating an immediate impact on software development and, in the longer term, on commerce, SaaS offerings, and personal financial management tools. 35  Accenture also highlights the development of AI agents capable of acting autonomously on behalf of individuals and organizations. 29
- ● Onchain Finance / Asset Tokenization: Advances in blockchain scalability and increasing regulatory clarity are creating an inflection point for onchain finance. The tokenization of real -world assets-such as bonds, private funds, and real estate -is seen as a larger opportunity than stablecoins for payments, with the potential to streamline processes and create new markets. 35 Major financial

institutions are reportedly actively piloting scalable use cases in this domain. 35 This is gaining traction particularly in North America and Europe as regulatory frameworks evolve. 8

- ● Quantum Technologies: The financial services sector is among the leading industries in the adoption of quantum computing, with over 40% of companies reportedly conducting experiments and pilot projects, particularly for complex modeling, risk analysis, and fraud prevention. 4 For example, HSBC is exploring quantum machine learning for customer data analysis and enhanced fraud detection. 4
- ● Immersive Reality / Spatial Computing: Accenture identifies spatial computing as an emerging medium, with a striking 92% of executives indicating that their organizations plan to leverage it to gain a competitive advantage. 29
- ● Advanced Connectivity (e.g., 5G): Financial services firms are among the leaders in adopting advanced connectivity solutions. 4 Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing, and 5G Networks are collectively ranked among the top three emerging technology categories that C - suite leaders anticipate will have the most significant impact on their industry in the near future. 44

The adoption of these truly emerging technologies is likely to see a gap between "pioneer" and "follower" firms. Deloitte's research on GenAI adoption shows that "pioneers" invest more, realize higher ROI, and are better prepared to scale innovations. 62 This suggests that for technologies like agentic AI, onchain finance, and quantum computing, the initial uptake will be concentrated among these innovation -forward financial institutions. "Followers" will likely adopt a more cautious stance, waiting for c learer use cases to emerge and for ROI to be demonstrably proven. Vendors operating in these emerging technology spaces should therefore focus on identifying and targeting these "pioneer" organizations within the financial services sector. Marketing and sa les efforts should be geared towards co - creation opportunities, pilot programs, and showcasing early successes to build broader market confidence. For "follower" organizations, messaging should place a greater emphasis on de-risking adoption and demonstrat ing clear, near-term value propositions.

## 3. Buyer Mindset by Role

Understanding the distinct perspectives, priorities, and concerns of the various individuals involved in the technology buying process is critical for effective engagement within financial services firms. The decision - making unit is often complex, involving IT leaders, business executives, and a growing cohort of specialized influencers. Regional differences in trust and regulatory environments can also shape these mindsets.

## How IT decision -makers (ITDMs) typically approach technology evaluation and risk

IT decision-makers, typically CIOs and their teams, approach technology evaluation with a multifaceted perspective, balancing innovation with pragmatism and robust risk management.

- ● Core Priorities: Their primary focus areas for investment include cybersecurity and information security, business intelligence and data analytics, cloud platforms, AI/ML, and application modernization. 45 A significant part of their mandate involves establishing and maintaining a robust IT governance framework, proactively managing evolving cyber threats, and strategically modernizing the core technology stack to support business objectives. 60
- ● Risk Management as a Cornerstone: Risk mitigation is a paramount concern for ITDMs. They are tasked with managing compliance obligations and operational risks, particularly in an environment where digital delivery models may be increasingly decentralized or "franchised". 45 The adoption of new technologies like GenAI brings additional risk considerations, necessitating a strong focus on responsible AI governance and data security. 3
- ○ Regional Lens: In EMEA, GDPR and AIspecific regulations heavily influence -risk assessment. 16 APAC ITDMs focus on cybersecurity amid increasing regulatory complexity. 24 NA ITDMs navigate a complex web of federal and state regulations. 8
- ● Articulating Business Value: There is a growing expectation for CIOs to effectively communicate the business value of technology investments to executive peers and the board. This involves "telling a good IT value story" 36 and clearly demonstrating how technology initiatives contribute to overall enterprise goals. 60
- ● Emphasis on Collaboration: Modern IT leadership emphasizes strong collaboration with business counterparts. Gartner highlights the importance of CIOs "co-leading, co-delivering, and co -governing" digital initiatives alongside CxOs. 45 Deloitte similarly notes that CIOs should actively coordinate with business peers to co -create a shared technology vision and strategy that aligns with enterprise objectives. 60 Ensuring that IT is perceived as a trusted and integral business partner is a key objective. 37
- ● Balancing Innovation with Efficiency: ITDMs constantly navigate the tension between investing in strategic, innovative technologies and the ongoing need for

IT cost optimization and operational efficiency. 45

ITDMs in financial services are therefore looking for technology solutions that are reliable, secure, scalable, and integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems. They place a high value on vendors who understand their critical need to demonstrate tangible business value and who can support collaborative operating models that bridge IT and business functions. A clear pathway for governance, risk mitigation, and compliance is essential for any new technology consideration.

## How business decision - makers (BDMs) frame goals, value, and buying criteria

Business decision-makers in financial services evaluate technology investments primarily through the lens of strategic business outcomes and quantifiable value.

- ● Strategic Alignment and Outcomes: BDMs frame technology adoption in the context of achieving overarching organizational strategic goals, desired business outcomes, and the urgency of these objectives. 36 Technology is viewed not as an end in itself, but as a critical enabler that helps the organization execute its strategic plans effectively. 36
- ● Focus on Value and ROI: The primary concern for BDMs is the quantifiable business impact of technology. This includes measurable improvements in growth, cost reduction, operational efficiency, or the creation of new business opportunities. 36 Deloitte emphasizes that securing buy - in from business leaders requires a clear alignment between technology investments and business incentives, alongside robust metrics to measure what truly drives value. 39
- ● Customer -Centricity: Particularly in customer -facing segments like banking, business leaders are highly focused on leveraging technology to improve the customer experience, build stronger relationships, and drive customer loyalty. 1
- ○ Regional Lens: APAC BDMs often prioritize mobile -first customer experiences. 24  EMEA BDMs are influenced by open banking's potential to reshape customer relationships. 16
- ● Innovation for Competitive Advantage and Growth: Business leaders who are pioneers in GenAI adoption cite benefits such as uncovering new ideas and insights, driving innovation and growth, and enhancing existing products and services as key drivers for their investments. 13
- ● The CFO Perspective: Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) are increasingly influential in digital transformation decisions. Their priorities often include enterprise risk management, rigorous cost optimization, and the digital transformation of the finance function itself. 66 In technology projects, CFOs focus on ensuring that

critical business requirements are met, that value creation is clearly defined and tracked, and that major risks are properly managed. 40  They also play a crucial role in ensuring that technology investments undergo rigorous evaluation and align with the company's capital allocation framework. 40

BDMs need to see a clear, demonstrable link between a proposed technology investment and tangible, positive business outcomes. They are significantly influenced by compelling use cases, verifiable proof of value, and solutions that directly address their specific strategic priorities and customer-centric objectives.

The CIO's role is evolving from a traditional technology leader to an "enterprise orchestrator" or "portfolio manager," akin to a venture capitalist, who co-leads digital strategy with business units. 45  This shift implies a decentralization of technology le a de rship, with business leaders increasingly taking ownership of digital product management within their domains. 37  For technology vendors, this means engaging a broader spectrum of "business technologists" beyond the central IT department. Marketing efforts must equip these business-side leaders with a clear understanding of how specific technologies can solve their unique problems, while simultaneously assuring central IT of robust governance and seamless integration capabilities. The sales process, therefore, becomes more intricate, requiring consensus-building across these distributed and diverse stakeholders.

Similarly, the CFO's role in technology decisions is transforming from a primary focus on cost control to that of a value enabler. While cost optimization remains a key CFO priority 66 , their involvement in digital transformation is increasingly centered on ensuring value realization, strategic alignment, and robust risk management, rather than solely policing budgets. 40 CFOs are concerned with "choosing appropriate technology" and ensuring that projects are directly linked to corporate strategy and deliver demonstrable ROI. 39  Accenture's finding that only 26% of CFOs trust their ESG data highlights a critical need for improved technology in areas under their purview. 18 Technology vendors must learn to articulate value in terms that resonate with CFOsemphasizing financial impact, risk mitigation, and strategic contribution. Comprehensive ROI calculations, well-structured business cases, and clear alignment with capital allocation frameworks are crucial. Engaging the CFO early in the buying cycle with a strong, financially sound value proposition can significantly accelerate decision-making.

Any new or rising influencers in the buying process (e.g., ESG, compliance, data

## leaders)

The traditional buying committee in financial services is expanding, with several roles gaining significant influence:

- ● Chief Data Officers (CDOs): The CDO role is rapidly gaining prominence. These leaders are responsible for spearheading enterprise - wide data and analytics strategies, overseeing platform engineering, establishing AI governance frameworks, and driving data product management. 67 Their expertise is crucial for harnessing the value of data assets and ensuring data quality, governance, and compliance, particularly with the proliferation of AI technologies. CDOs are therefore key stakeholders and decision - influencers for any data -centric technologies, advanced analytics platforms, and AI solutions.
- ● ESG Leaders / Sustainability Officers: As Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors transition from a peripheral concern to a core strategic priority and a significant regulatory requirement, individuals leading these initiatives are becoming important influencers in technology decis ions. They shape choices related to ESG data management platforms, sustainability reporting tools, and compliance management software. 41 Vendors offering ESGrelated solutions must engage these influencers, demonstrating how their technology can help achieve sustainability goals and meet complex compliance mandates, such as CSRD in EMEA. 8 1
- ● Compliance Officers: While always a critical function in the highly regulated financial services sector, the influence of Compliance Officers is likely amplified by the introduction of new and evolving regulations pertaining to AI, data privacy, and cybersecurity. 8 Technology solutions must clearly and comprehensively address all relevant compliance requirements to gain their approval. Regional regulatory nuances (e.g., GDPR in EMEA  7 , specific APAC data rules  24 ) make their 1 input critical.
- ● Risk Officers: Given the industry's heightened focus on managing "all the risk we cannot see"   and the imperative to implement robust risk management 1 frameworks, Chief Risk Officers (CROs) and their teams are vital influencers in technology procurement. Technologies that address risk identification, assessment, mitigation, and ongoing management wi ll require CRO buy-in.
- ● Diverse Functional Participation in Buying Teams: It's important to note that buying decisions are increasingly made by diverse teams. Gartner observes that buying teams with broader functional participation tend to achieve greater clarity on goals and typically make decisions more rapidly. 36 Forrester's research indicates that, on average, 13 individuals are involved in a typical B2B purchasing

decision. 68 This underscores the need for marketing and sales strategies that can effectively cater to a wide array of stakeholders, each with their unique needs, priorities, and perspectives within the buying group.

## General mindset: innovation - forward, risk - averse, efficiency - led, etc.

The general mindset within the financial services industry towards technology adoption is complex and often characterized by a tension between caution and the drive for innovation.

- ● Predominantly Risk - Averse:  The financial services sector is traditionally characterized as risk -averse, particularly when it comes to adopting new and unproven technologies. 69 A survey by Davies found that 59% of financial services firms explicitly describe their attitude towards new technology adoption as risk -averse. 70 BCG also notes that central banks, a segment within financial services, often exhibit a more risk -averse culture compared to nimbler FinTech competitors. 69 This inherent caution necessitates that technology vendors provide exceptionally strong proof points, robust security assurances, clear compliance roadmaps, and compelling ROI calculations to overcome skepticism.
- ○ Regional Trust Levels: Trust in financial institutions varies regionally. While US customers generally show strong trust 20 , European banks (except in the UK) often face lower trust levels, with deficiencies noted in dependability and empathy. 20  APAC has a mixed landscape, with high trust in some markets like China but potential gaps elsewhere. 20 These trust levels can influence risk perception and adoption speed.
- ● Emergence of "Digital Vanguards" / "Pioneers": Despite the prevailing risk aversion, a distinct segment of financial services firms is demonstrably innovation -forward. These "pioneers" or "digital vanguards" are actively exploring and investing in cutting - edge technologies like GenAI, often achieving significant value and higher success rates in their digital initiatives. 62 This creates a bifurcated market. Vendors can target these pioneers with messages emphasizing transformative potential and cutting - edge solutions. For the broader, more cautious market segment, messaging should focus more on proven value, risk mitigation  strategies, and tangible efficiency gains.
- ● Efficiency - Led:  A strong underlying driver for technology adoption is the continuous pursuit of operational efficiency and cost optimization. This is fueled by economic pressures and the imperative to streamline complex processes. 1 Technology is often viewed, at a foundational level, as an "efficiency enabler". 36 Solutions that clearly demonstrate efficiency improvements and cost savings will

therefore resonate widely across the industry.

- ● Shift Towards Recognizing the Strategic Value of IT: Gartner highlights the importance of understanding whether an organization views technology primarily as critical to its business strategy or mainly as an efficiency enabler. 36 The increasing prominence of CIOs as strategic partners to the business 45 suggests a growing recognition of IT's strategic importance beyond mere operational support. Messaging strategies should adapt based on whether the primary driver for a specific buyer is strategic transformation or operational efficiency.

The inherent risk aversion within financial services, coupled with the often "black box" nature of emerging technologies like advanced AI, creates a significant "trust deficit" that vendors must overcome. Concerns regarding the reliability, security, and e thical implications of AI 27 mean that buyers require more than just lists of features and functionalities. They are seeking "trusted intelligence". 28 To bridge this gap, vendors must invest heavily in building trust through transparency, robust security measures, well-defined governance frameworks, third - party validations (such as analyst reports and industry certifications), and compelling, verifiable proof points, including case studies and successful pilot results specifically from the financial services sector. Demonstrating a profound understanding of the unique risks within financial services and how the proposed technology effectively mitigates t hem is paramount.

## 4. Messaging and Content Preferences

To effectively engage B2B technology buyers in the financial services industry, marketers must craft narratives and content that resonate with their specific needs, concerns, and decision -making styles. This involves understanding preferred tones, formats,  language, and avoiding common pitfalls, while also tailoring approaches to regional nuances.

## Narrative tones and angles that resonate

Certain narrative approaches are more effective than others in capturing the attention and building credibility with financial services buyers:

- ● Trust and Transparency: This is foundational in a sector built on fiduciary responsibility and subject to stringent regulation. Forrester's research identifies competence, consistency, and dependability as top trust levers for B2B buyers generally, with regulated industries like financial services placing a more even value on all trust levers. 74 Customers explicitly state they want banks to reassure

them with trust and transparency in all interactions. 28 Accenture emphasizes the critical need to transform "Artificial" intelligence into "Trusted" intelligence, particularly as AI adoption grows. 28  Messaging must, therefore, be inherently credible, consistently backed by verifiable evidence, and clearly articulate how the proposed solution ensures security, reliability, and ongoing compliance.

- ○ Regional Trust Dynamics: In North America, competence, consistency, and dependability are key trust levers. 74 European buyers also prioritize these but may have lower overall trust in banks (except UK), emphasizing the need for messages reinforcing dependability and empathy. 20 APAC buyers value consistency, integrity, and accountability. 74
- ● Value - Driven and ROI -Focused:  Financial services executives demand a clear line of sight between technology investment and business impact. Content should meticulously quantify the anticipated business benefits and demonstrate how the solution mitigates risks. 36 The focus should be on how technology drives tangible business value and helps achieve specific strategic objectives. 39 This requires incorporating clear ROI calculations, robust business cases, and metrics that are meaningful to financial services leaders.
- ● Human -Centric and Empathetic: As digital interactions become more prevalent, the human element in communication becomes even more critical. Banks are increasingly focused on designing digital experiences that foster emotional engagement 9 and enable "meaningful conversations" with their customers. 1  Accenture's "Technology Vision 2024" strongly advocates for making technology "more human" in its design and interaction. 29 The LinkedIn B2B Institute highlights the emergence of a "Relationship Economy," where genuine connections and trust are paramount, and marketers are expected to act as "trusted advisors". 32 Messaging should demonstrate a deep understanding of the buyer's unique challenges and aspirations, positioning the vendor as a supportive partner.
- ● Expertise and Industry Specificity: Generic messaging that lacks a deep understanding of the financial services sector will inevitably fall flat. Buyers expect vendors to demonstrate a nuanced comprehension of their industry, including its unique operational challenges, competitive dynamics , and complex regulatory environment. Content must be tailored with FS - specific language, relevant use cases, and illustrative examples. This includes acknowledging regional regulatory differences (e.g., PSD2 in EMEA, T+1 in NA).
- ● Innovation Tempered with Pragmatism: While financial services firms are increasingly exploring innovation, particularly with technologies like GenAI 62 ,

messaging should carefully balance the allure of transformative potential with practical considerations for implementation, risk mitigation, and seamless integration with existing systems. Overhyping capabilities without a clear, achievable path to value can be detrimental.

The "trust but verify AND quantify" imperative is central to effective messaging. While building trust is paramount  28 , it cannot be established on vague promises alone. Financial services buyers, conditioned by a culture of risk management and regulatory oversight, require tangible proof. This means that vendor claims of "competence, consistency, and dependability"  74  must be substantiated through verifiable data  36 , credible case studies  33 , a nd validation from respected third parties like  industry analysts.  The consistent demand for clear ROI  36  is a direct extension of 7 this fundamental need for verification. Consequently, content strategies must adopt a dual focus: building emotional trust through empathetic understanding and industry expertise  1 , while simultaneously providing hard, quantifiable evidence of value and reliability. This necessitates a sophisticated blend of compelling storytelling and datarich proof points.

## Formats and types of proof that influence decisions

Financial services buyers rely on a variety of information formats and types of proof to inform their technology decisions:

- ● Analyst Reports: The significant reliance on firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC, as evidenced by the user's query and the sources provided, underscores the profound influence of analyst validation. Analyst reports are explicitly mentioned as a resource for procurement guidance. 7 Positive mentions, leadership rankings, and favorable assessments in these reports serve as powerful, independent proof points.
- ● Case Studies:  Client case studies, particularly those that feature third - party experts or well -respected industry peers, are described as "surefire B2B winners". 33 Success stories that clearly demonstrate ROI and solve relatable industry challenges are highly impactful. 63 Financial services buyers want to see concrete evidence of successful implementations within similar organizations, ideally within their specific region and sub - sector.
- ● Data - Backed Content: Quantifiable impact and clearly presented metrics are crucial. 36 Vendors should use credible data to demonstrate value, calculate potential ROI, and support claims. White papers, research reports, and interactive ROI calculators that are grounded in solid data are persuasive tools.
- ● Multiple Content Pieces and Formats: Buyers typically consume a significant amount of content -an average of seven pieces-before directly engaging with a vendor. 33 This necessitates a diverse content portfolio. Marketers should offer a mix of formats, including in -depth insights, concise social media posts, engaging videos, informative podcasts, interactive landing pages 33 , and expert-led webinars. 10
- ● Proof of Concept (PoC) / Pilots: Especially for newer or more complex technologies like GenAI, PoCs and pilot programs are critical for validating value and mitigating perceived risks before committing to wider adoption. 27 Offering low-risk, well-defined PoCs can be a key conversion tool in the sales process.
- ● Peer Insights and Networks: Buyers in this risk-conscious industry often validate solutions and vendor claims through their professional peer networks. 36 Facilitating peer connections, user groups, or showcasing testimonials from respected industry figures can be highly influential.

As AI increasingly automates various aspects of interaction and content delivery 1 , the value of genuine human connection and expertise in messaging is amplified. Accenture's "human by design" philosophy 29 and LinkedIn's concept of the "Relationship Economy"  32  both point to this trend. Even when AI tools are employed, the emphasis should be on augmenting  human creativity, judgment, and empathy. 32 Caution against over -relying on AI for final content publication, particularly in direct communications, is warranted, as it can be perceived negatively if not handled appropriately. 33 Marketers should strategically use AI for personalization and scale but ensure that the core messaging retains an authentic, empathetic, and expert human voice. Highlighting human expertise, dedicated support, and a partnership approach in content will li kely resonate more deeply than purely technology - driven narratives.

## Common metaphors, language, or frameworks used by buyers

Using language and frameworks familiar to financial services professionals helps messaging resonate and demonstrates an understanding of their context and priorities. Common terms and concepts include:

- ● "Digital Transformation" 5
- ● "Customer -Centricity" / "Customer Experience (CX)" 1
- ● "Risk Management" / "Risk Mitigation" / "Compliance" 5
- ● "Efficiency" / "Optimization" / "Productivity"

1

- ● "Innovation" 9
- ● "Value" / "Return on Investment (ROI)" 10
- ● "Agility" 5
- ● "Resilience"  5
- ● "Data-Driven"  9
- ● "Human + Machine" / "Human by Design" 1

Incorporating this established lexicon into marketing communications ensures that messages are immediately recognizable and align with the buyer's existing conceptual frameworks and strategic priorities.

## Common messaging mistakes or overused tropes that fail in this industry

Certain messaging approaches can undermine credibility and fail to connect with financial services buyers:

- ● Generic AI/Technology Hype: Focusing excessively on technology features or generic AI capabilities without grounding them in specific, relevant financial services use cases or demonstrating quantifiable business value is a common mistake. 40 Promoting "AI for AI's sake" will not resonate with pragmatic FS buyers.
- ● Ignoring or Underestimating Regulatory Complexity: Downplaying, or worse, failing to address the stringent and multifaceted regulatory and compliance requirements inherent in financial services (and their regional variations) will immediately raise red flags.
- ● Lack of FS -Specific and Regionally Relevant Proof Points: Relying on case studies or examples from unrelated industries (e.g., retail, manufacturing) or from vastly different regulatory/market environments fails to demonstrate a true understanding of and applicability to the unique challenges faced by financial institutions.
- ● Overpromising and Under - delivering: Particularly with emerging technologies, setting unrealistic expectations about capabilities or implementation timelines can severely damage trust and long -term relationships.
- ● "Solutionism" Without Deep Problem Understanding: Offering pre -packaged solutions before thoroughly understanding the specific pain points, strategic context, and operational realities of the individual financial services buyer or sub -sector.
- ● Over -Reliance on AI -Generated Content for Direct Outreach: While AI can assist in content formulation, relying solely on AI - generated content for direct customer communication can be perceived negatively if discovered, and may suffer from quality or authenticity issues. 33 As noted, GenAI is often best used for
- "formulation, not publication" in many direct communication scenarios. 33
- ● Not Addressing Security and Data Privacy Upfront and Thoroughly: These are non-negotiable, table -stakes considerations in financial services. Failing to proactively and comprehensively highlight robust security measures and data privacy protocols is a major oversight.

Avoiding these common pitfalls is critical for maintaining credibility, building trust, and fostering successful long - term relationships with B2B technology buyers in the financial services industry.

Given that buying groups in financial services can involve an average of 13 people 68 and include diverse functional representation 36 , content must be designed to serve the entire complex buying committee, not just a single persona. ITDMs will have different questions and concerns (e.g., security, integration, scalability 45 ) than BDMs (e.g., strategic outcomes, customer impact 36 ), CFOs (e.g., ROI, risk mitigation 40 ), or CDOs (e.g., data governance, AI model integrity 67 ). A multi-faceted content strategy is therefore essential. This involves creating a range of content types -such as technical whitepapers, business value assessments, detailed ROI calculators, and strategic thought leadership pieces -each tailored to the sp ecific informational needs and priorities of various members of the buying committee. A "one - size- fits all" approach to content is unlikely to be effective. Marketers should meticulously map their content assets to different buyer roles and the distinct st ages of their decision-making journey.

The following table provides a framework for aligning content strategy with key buyer personas:

## 5. Buying Journey &amp; Channel Behavior

B2B technology buyers in the financial services sector follow a deliberate and often complex journey when researching, evaluating, and selecting solutions. This process is influenced by multiple information channels, internal stakeholders, and the industry's inherent risk-aware culture. Understanding regional variations in channel preferences and journey pacing is also key.

## Where and how buyers research, validate, and compare solutions

The research phase for financial services technology buyers is typically extensive and multi-faceted:

- ● Significant Pre - Sales Research:  A substantial portion of the customer discovery process, estimated at up to 80%, occurs before any direct engagement with a vendor. 33 Buyers are proactive in seeking information and often consume multiple pieces of content -an average of seven-before initiating contact with a sales representative. 33 This underscores the critical importance of a strong, informative online presence and readily accessible, valuable content for vendors targeting this sector.
- ● Multi - Channel Approach: Buyers utilize a diverse mix of channels to gather information and form opinions. The LinkedIn B2B Institute identifies social media, email, and Connected TV (CTV) as increasingly important channels for content strategists to reach B2B audiences. 76
- ○ Regional Channel Preferences: Mobile channels are paramount in APAC due to high mobile -first adoption. 24
- ● Vendor Websites and Owned Media: Corporate websites, blogs, and other owned media channels serve as primary sources for detailed product information, technical specifications, and company background. 63
- ● Industry Analyst Firms: Reports and evaluations from respected analyst firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC play a crucial role in the research and validation process. These firms are often used for initial vendor longlisting, capability assessment, and market positioning. 7 Gartner, for instance, offers tools like "BuySmart" to help clients purchase marketing technology with confidence. 37
- ● Peer Networks and Professional Communities: Buyers in the financial services industry frequently consult with peers and colleagues within their professional networks for recommendations, experiences, and validation of vendor claims. 36
- ● Industry Events and Conferences: These gatherings provide valuable opportunities for learning about emerging trends, discovering new solutions, engaging directly with vendors, and networking with peers. 24
- ● Emerging Role of AI in Research: There is an observable shift where buyers are increasingly using AI models and tools for research, alongside traditional search engines (SEO). This trend necessitates that vendors optimize their content for

discovery through both conventional and AI - driven search mechanisms. 33

The prevalence of extensive pre-sales research across multiple channels and the involvement of large buying groups  36  suggests a "democratization of diligence." In this environment, every member of the buying committee can, and often does, become an independent researcher and validator. This extends beyond a single internal champion; multiple individuals are likely cross-referencing vendor claims against analyst reports, peer opinions, and other available information. For vendors, this means ensuring that consistent, accurate, and comprehensive information is readily available across all potential touchpoints. Any weak link in this information chain-such as an outdated website, a poorly managed social media presence, or negative peer reviews-can significantly derail the evaluation process. Content strategies must therefore cater to this distributed and thorough diligence.

## Role of analysts, events, partners, or peer networks

Various external entities and networks significantly influence the buying journey:

- ● Analysts: Industry analysts from firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC are highly influential in shaping buyer perceptions, aiding in vendor shortlisting, and providing third -party validation of technology capabilities and market standing. 7 Favorable mentions and leadership positions in analyst reports are considered significant assets by vendors.
- ● Events:  Industry-specific events, conferences, and trade shows are key venues for networking, learning about new trends and solutions, and facilitating direct engagement between buyers and vendors. 24 Regional events are crucial for understanding local market nuances and connecting with local buyers.
- ● Partners:  Technology partners, system integrators, and consulting firms (including major players like Accenture and Deloitte who are themselves sources in this report) often play a crucial role in solution recommendation, implementation, and ongoing support, especi ally for complex, large -scale technology projects. 10 Building and nurturing a strong partner ecosystem can significantly extend a vendor's reach and credibility within the financial services market.
- ● Peer Networks: In a risk- averse industry like financial services, word -of-mouth recommendations and insights shared within trusted peer networks carry considerable weight. 36 Facilitating customer advocacy programs and enabling peer-to-peer sharing of experiences can be a powerful influencing factor.

## Common sales cycle patterns: fast/slow, consensus - driven, RFP-heavy, etc.

The sales cycle for B2B technology in the financial services industry typically exhibits several distinct characteristics:

- ● Consensus -Driven:  Buying decisions almost invariably involve multiple stakeholders. Forrester's research indicates an average of 13 people are involved in a B2B purchasing decision  68 , and Gartner notes that buying teams with diverse functional participation, if clear on their goals, can make decisions more effectively. 36 This inherent need for consensus across various departments and roles often leads to longer and more complex sales cycles, requiring vendors to engage and align multiple decision -makers and influencers.
- ● RFP-Heavy:  While not explicitly detailed in all provided materials, the procurement of large, complex technology solutions in a highly regulated industry like financial services often involves formal Request for Proposal (RFP)
