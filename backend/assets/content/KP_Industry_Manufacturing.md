## Navigating the Evolving Landscape: Understanding B2B

## Technology Buyers in the Manufacturing Sector

## 1. Industry Context

The manufacturing sector is undergoing a period of profound transformation, driven by a confluence of technological advancements, economic shifts, and evolving market demands. Understanding this dynamic context is crucial for B2B technology providers aimin g to effectively engage manufacturing buyers.

## Major trends, economic forces, and transformation drivers

Several interconnected forces are reshaping the manufacturing industry globally:

- ● Digital Transformation (Industry 4.0): This remains the paramount driver of change. Manufacturers are increasingly adopting a suite of digital technologies -including Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and automation -to enhance operational capabilities, accelerate product development, reduce time -to-market, and more effectively meet fluctuating customer demands. 1  A significant 92% of manufacturers surveyed by Deloitte for its 2025 Smart Manufacturing Survey believe smart manufacturing will be the primary engine of competitiveness over the next three years, an increase from previous surveys. 3  The ultimate vision for many is the "factory of the future," characterized by hyper -automation, AI-driven optimization, and seamlessly integrated systems. 4 This pursuit of Industry 4.0 is not merely about incremental technology adoption; it represents a fundamental strategic shift in how manufacturing processes, business models, and entire value chains are conceived and managed.
- ● Economic Forces: The global economic climate significantly impacts manufacturing. Recent years have seen inflationary pressures, concerns over potential recessions, and persistent labor market tightness -although the latter showed signs of easing in the US manufacturing se ctor in 2024. 6 Some segments of the manufacturing industry experienced revenue downturns in 2023. 7 However, reports like the ISM's anticipate revenue growth for the broader manufacturing sector in 2024. 7 A particular challenge, especially for European manufacturers, is the high cost of energy. 8 Such economic uncertainties amplify the imperative for operational efficiency and cost reduction, thereby increasing the attractiveness of technology solutions that can deliver measurable Return on Investment (ROI).
- ● Supply Chain Resilience: The widespread disruptions experienced in recent

years have elevated supply chain resilience from a secondary concern to a primary strategic priority for manufacturers worldwide. 9  Companies are actively investing in technologies and adopting new strategies, such as regionalization of supply sources and nearshoring of production, to mitigate risks and enhance operational visibility. 12 Notably, industrial firms in North America have demonstrated considerable progress in bolstering their supply chain resilience. 10 This heightened focus means that technologies offering improved supply chain visibility, predictive capabilities, and enhanced agility are experiencing high demand.

- ● Sustainability and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Imperatives: There is mounting pressure on manufacturers to advance decarbonization efforts, improve resource efficiency, and uphold ethical labor practices. These factors are increasingly influencing technology adoption decisions. 1 Sustainability is transitioning from a reluctantly met obligation to a core element of competitive strategy and market differentiation. 10 This trend has a direct bearing on technology choices, with a clear preference emerging for solutions that support green initiatives, enable comprehensive ESG reporting, and contribute to a circular economy.
- ● Talent Shortages and the Skills Gap: A persistent and critical challenge for the manufacturing sector is the difficulty in attracting, recruiting, and retaining skilled labor. Furthermore, upskilling the existing workforce to operate and manage increasingly sophisticated smart factory enviro nments is a major hurdle. 3 Deloitte research highlights a stark projection: 1.9 million manufacturing jobs in the United States could remain unfilled over the next decade if these talent issues are not proactively addressed. 6 This skills gap directly fuels investment in automation technologies, AI-powered tools that augment human capabilities, and systems that can reduce the dependency on scarce, highly specialized skills.

The convergence of these diverse macro -level pressures-economic volatility, supply chain vulnerabilities, acute talent scarcity, and escalating sustainability mandates -is creating a powerful catalyst. It's compelling manufacturers to view technology not merely as a tool for incremental efficiency gains, but as an indispensable enabler of fundamental resilience, enhanced competitiveness, and, in some cases, long - term viability. This collective impact fosters a more profound and holistic demand for technologi cal solutions than any single pressure would generate in isolation. Manufacturers are not just seeking to solve isolated problems; they are striving to architect an entirely new operational paradigm fit for a rapidly changing world.

## Common business models and how they shape buying behavior

The way manufacturers create and deliver value is evolving, significantly influencing their technology procurement behaviors:

- ● Shift from Product - Centric to Solutions/Services: A notable trend, particularly within the machinery and equipment sub - sector, is the transition from selling standalone physical products to offering integrated solutions. 19 These solutions often bundle hardware with software, sophisticated aftermarket services, and valuable data-driven insights. John Deere's strategic pivot from being primarily a tractor manufacturer to a provider of comprehensive precision agriculture solutions serves as a prominent illustration of this shift. 21 This evolution towards "solutions -as-a-service" or outcome -based contracts means that technology buyers are increasingly seeking long -term, strategic partners and integrated technology platforms, rather than simply making transactional purchases of point solutions. Buying decisions, therefore, become more strategic, involve a broader array of internal stakeholders, and place a higher premium on the vendor's understanding of specific industry verticals and the customer's desired business outcomes.
- ● Growth of Aftermarket Services: Leveraging digital transformation to enhance and expand aftermarket services is a key strategy for increasing customer loyalty and generating new revenue streams. 1 The deployment of digital models for installed machinery, for instance, can significantly improve product performance and enable predictive maintenance capabilities. 20 This creates a strong demand for technologies such as IoT for data acquisition, advanced analytics for insight generation, and robust Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to support proactive service delivery and ongoing customer engagement.
- ● Emergence of Data - Driven Business Models: The capability to collect, analyze, and act upon data generated from products, processes, and customer interactions is enabling manufacturers to develop entirely new service offerings and achieve unprecedented levels of operational efficiency. 2 This directly influences the procurement of technologies related to data management, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

This fundamental evolution in business models, particularly the move towards providing comprehensive solutions and services, is reshaping technology procurement. It transforms the buyer - vendor relationship from a series of discrete transactions into a more  strategic, long -term partnership. Technology vendors are now expected to possess a deeper understanding of their manufacturing clients'

specific industry challenges and their ultimate business objectives, as the acquired technology must directly contribute to the outcomes the manufacturer promises to its own customers.

## Regulatory or compliance pressures affecting technology decisions

A complex web of regulations and compliance mandates significantly shapes technology investment decisions in the manufacturing sector:

- ● ESG Reporting and Compliance: The volume of ESG-related regulations has surged globally, with a reported 155% increase between 2011 and 2023. 16 This is a powerful driver for the adoption of technologies that facilitate robust data collection, sophisticated analysis, and transparent reporting across environmental (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, waste management  1 ), social (e.g., labor practices, workplace safety, diversity and inclusion  ), and governance (e.g., business ethics, data transparency, risk 1 management  15 ) dimensions. Technology vendors must be prepared to clearly demonstrate how their solutions enable manufacturers to meet these intricate and evolving ESG requirements, which are rapidly moving from a niche concern to a mainstream business imperative. 14
- ● Cybersecurity Regulations: As manufacturing operations become increasingly interconnected through smart technologies and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), adherence to stringent cybersecurity standards is paramount. This is especially critical for protecting Operational Tec hnology (OT) environments from cyber threats. 3 Consequently, robust security features, certifications for relevant cybersecurity standards, and a vendor's demonstrated commitment to security are key evaluation criteria for any new technology procurement.
- ● Safety Regulations: Technology plays an increasingly vital role in helping manufacturers ensure compliance with stringent workplace safety regulations. This is achieved through advanced monitoring systems, automation of hazardous tasks, and immersive training solutions. 1 Solutions that demonstrably enhance workplace safety and reduce operational risks have a strong appeal, particularly to plant managers, operations leaders, and those responsible for ESG's social components.

## Key sub -sectors within this industry, and how buyer behavior may differ across them

The manufacturing industry is not monolithic; buyer behavior and technology priorities vary considerably across its diverse sub - sectors. Technology vendors must recognize these nuances to tailor their offerings and messaging effectively. 26

## Regional Spotlight: Significant economic and structural differences in NA, EMEA, APAC affecting the industry context

The global manufacturing landscape is characterized by distinct regional dynamics:

- ● North America (NA): There is a discernible trend towards a "return to basics," with a strong emphasis on bolstering supply chain resilience and exploring vertical integration strategies. 10 Significant government investments are being channeled into manufacturing infrastructure and critical technology sectors, such as semiconductors and clean energy, with the aim of enhancing national competitiveness and promoting reshoring/nearshoring. 11 Persistent labor shortages and the imperative to upskill the workforce remain key concerns for manufacturers in this region. 3 The United States stands as the second -largest manufacturing nation globally when measured by real value added. 35
- ● EMEA (Europe):  European manufacturers face a challenging environment marked by high energy costs, a complex and evolving regulatory landscape (including the ambitious EU Green Deal), and a persistent gap in effectively commercializing its strong research and development output, despite notable strengths in emerging technologies like AI and digital twins. 8 Private sector R&amp;D spending in Europe tends to lag behind that of the US and China, with a historical focus on mid -tech industries rather than high - tech sectors. 8 Consequently, European tech start -ups often scale more slowly compared to their US counterparts. 37 Additionally, there is a growing strategic need to increase defense manufacturing capabilities within the EU. 8
- ● APAC: This region is exceptionally dynamic and diverse, frequently setting global

technology trends rather than merely adopting them, particularly in areas such as Generative AI and advanced robotics. 38  Strong governmental support for ICT investment and innovation is evident, especially in countries like China, South Korea, and Taiwan. 32  The adoption of GenAI is rapid, with the APAC region second only to North America in uptake. 39  Key manufacturing hubs, for example in Vietnam and Thailand, are witnessing increased investment in IoT technologies. 38 China continues to be a dominant global force across numerous manufacturing sectors. 35

These regional disparities in innovation ecosystems-such as EMEA's challenge in commercializing R&amp;D versus APAC's rapid technology adoption often fueled by government support, and North America's policy-driven reshoring and critical industry initiatives-create distinct go-to-market opportunities and challenges for technology vendors. A standardized global strategy is unlikely to achieve optimal results. Instead, vendors must meticulously tailor their value propositions, partnership models, and market engagement strategies to align with the specific economic strengths, innovation weaknesses, and prevailing policy environments characteristic of each major region. This requires a level of strategic nuance that extends far beyond simple language translation or superficial market sizing.

## 2. Technology Investment Priorities

Manufacturers globally are strategically investing in a range of technologies to drive transformation, enhance competitiveness, and address pressing operational challenges. These investments reflect a blend of modernizing foundational systems and embracing  cutting -edge innovations.

## Top IT and business -led technology investment areas

Several technology categories are consistently prioritized by manufacturing leaders:

- ● Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Generative AI (GenAI): AI is a dominant investment theme. Gartner's top strategic technology trends for 2024 prominently feature AI Trust, Risk, and Safety Management (AI TRiSM), AIaugmented development, Intelligent Applications, and Democratized Generative AI. 13 McKinsey echoes this, identifying the "AI revolution" -encompassing Generative AI, Applied AI, and Industrializing Machine Learning -as a leading tech trend for 2024. 27 Manufacturers are channeling funds into AI for diverse applications, including process optimization, predictive maintenance, quality control enhancements, demand forecasting, and even innovative product design. 1

Deloitte's 2025 Smart Manufacturing Survey found that 29% of manufacturers are utilizing AI/ML at the facility or network level, with 24% having deployed Generative AI. 3  Accenture's research indicates that AI and GenAI applications for logistics, maintenance, and production planning are near-term priorities for factory managers. 4  The trajectory of AI is clearly moving from experimental pilot projects to widespread operational deployment, driven by its significant potential to address multiple critical challenges such as cost efficiency, product quality, and persistent labor shortages. GenAI, in particular, is an area of intense interest, with new applications rapidly emerging across the entire manufacturing value chain.

- ● Internet of Things (IoT) / Industrial IoT (IIoT): IIoT technology is fundamental for comprehensive data capture from machinery and processes. It serves as a key enabler for smart manufacturing initiatives, predictive maintenance programs, and the development of digital twins. 1 Deloitte's findings report that 46% of manufacturers are currently employing IIoT solutions within their operations. 3 IIoT effectively provides the essential data backbone required for many other advanced technologies and operational improvement strategies.

-

- ● Cloud Computing (including Edge Computing): Cloud platforms are essential for achieving scalability, managing vast data storage needs, and enabling advanced analytics and AI applications. 2 According to Deloitte, 57% of manufacturers are leveraging cloud computing at the facility or network level. 3 Within this domain, edge computing is gaining significant traction, particularly for applications in manufacturing plants where minimizing latency is critical for real time control and decision -making. 27  Gartner also identifies Industry Cloud Platforms as a specific strategic trend. 13 Cloud technology is foundational for modernizing IT infrastructure and supporting the increasingly data - intensive applications vital to contemporary manufacturing.
- ● Cybersecurity: This remains a critical investment area, driven by the increased connectivity of manufacturing systems and the inherent vulnerabilities of Operational Technology (OT) environments. 3 Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) is highlighted by Gartner as a key trend for 2024. 13 Underscoring this focus, 68% of manufacturers reported performing a cybersecurity risk assessment of their smart manufacturing technology stack within the last year. 3 As factories become "smarter" and more interconnected, the imperative to protect operational integrity, sensitive intellectual property, and customer data becomes paramount.
- ● Automation (Process &amp; Physical): Automation continues to be a high - priority

investment area, aimed at improving operational efficiency, addressing ongoing labor shortages, and enhancing workplace safety. 1  Deloitte's survey indicates that 46% of manufacturers rank process automation as a top one or two investment priority, with 37% citing physical automation similarly. 3  Investment in factory automation hardware is a leading priority for 41% of respondents. 3 Automation in manufacturing spans a wide spectrum, from software-based robotic process automation (RPA) for administrative tasks to advanced robotics and autonomous systems on the factory floor.

- ● Data Analytics: The ability to derive actionable insights from the vast quantities of data generated by modern manufacturing operations is a key investment driver.  Deloitte reports that 57% of manufacturers are leveraging data analytics 1 at the facility or network level. 3 Advanced analytics capabilities are the engine behind data -driven decision -making, enabling process optimization, predictive quality control, and more accurate forecasting.
- ● Sustainable Technology: There is a growing trend of investment in technologies that directly support corporate social responsibility (CSR) goals, improve energy efficiency, reduce waste, and facilitate the transition to a circular economy. 1 This investment is propelled by a combination of increasing regulatory pressure and growing market demand for sustainably produced goods and transparent, ethical operations.

The hierarchy of these technology investments suggests that many manufacturers are still in a foundational build - out phase, focusing on cloud migration, establishing robust data infrastructure, and modernizing core operational systems. This is occurring ev en as they simultaneously explore and pilot more advanced, AI - driven applications. This dual focus creates a significant opportunity for technology vendors: they can support manufacturers in shoring up their core digital foundations while also enabling the m to innovate with cutting - edge solutions. Vendors offering phased approaches or solutions capable of bridging legacy systems with modern platforms are likely to be well -positioned to meet these diverse needs.

## Patterns of modernization vs. optimization

Manufacturers are generally pursuing a dual strategy of modernizing their core technology backbone while simultaneously optimizing existing processes with new digital tools:

- ● Modernization of Core Systems: Significant investments are being directed towards upgrading foundational systems. Deloitte's 2025 Smart Manufacturing

Survey highlights advanced production scheduling (35%), manufacturing execution systems (MES, 33%), and quality management systems (QMS, 28%) as high-priority areas for investment in the next two years. 3  Upgrading Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems is also a noted priority. 31  This pattern indicates a clear focus on strengthening the fundamental digital capabilities that underpin modern manufacturing operations. Many manufacturers are still contending with legacy systems that can impede agility, hinder data integration, and limit the adoption of more advanced digital initiatives. Modernizing these core systems is often a prerequisite for unlocking further value from Industry 4.0 technologies.

- ● Optimization of Existing Processes: Alongside modernization, substantial investment is aimed at optimizing current operations. This is being achieved through the strategic application of automation, AI - driven insights, and more effective data utilization. 1 The goals of these optimization efforts typically include improving production output, boosting employee productivity, and unlocking previously constrained capacity. 3 Optimization initiatives often target immediate operational pain points related to cost, efficiency, and quality, thereby delivering tangible and relatively quick ROI.
- ● A Balancing Act: The prevailing pattern is not an either/or choice between modernization and optimization, but rather a concurrent pursuit of both. Manufacturers are actively upgrading outdated systems to create a more robust and flexible technology foundation, while simu ltaneously leveraging new technologies, particularly AI and analytics, to enhance existing processes and workflows. There's a pragmatic approach, especially noted in North America, where AI applications are often focused on "back - to - basics" improvements in internal operations and productivity rather than purely speculative or experimental ventures. 10

## Infrastructure limitations or legacy constraints

Despite the push for modernization, many manufacturers grapple with existing infrastructure challenges:

- ● Outdated IT Infrastructure: The presence of aging IT infrastructure can significantly hamper the ability to integrate new technologies effectively, leading to operational inefficiencies, data silos, and increased security vulnerabilities. 24 Legacy systems often lack the flexibility and scalability required by modern digital solutions and can complicate data management and analytics efforts.
- ● System Integration Challenges: Disconnected systems across different

departments and operational areas frequently cause inefficiencies and hinder the seamless flow and alignment of data. 24  A key challenge, and therefore a priority, is the effective integration of Information Technology (IT) systems (which manage data and business processes) with Operational Technology (OT) systems (which control physical manufacturing processes). 42  The convergence of IT and OT is a cornerstone of Industry 4.0 , but successfully bridging this historical divide requires careful planning, strategic investment, and often, cultural change within the organization.

- ● Skills Gap for New Technologies: A significant constraint is the lack of readily available technical expertise to effectively adopt, manage, and leverage new technologies. 3 Even with state-of-the-art infrastructure, a workforce that is not adequately equipped with the necessary digital skills will limit the value derived from technology investments.

The significant emphasis on AI Trust, Risk, and Safety Management (AI TRiSM)  13  and the broader focus on cybersecurity for smart manufacturing environments 3 signal a maturing perspective within the industry. As technologies like AI and IoT become more powerful and deeply integrated into core operations, there is a corresponding growth in awareness that the potential risks -such as data breaches, operational disruptions due to cyber -attacks, or the deployment of biased AI models -also escalate. This indicates a shift beyond initial enthusiasm for new technological capabilities towards a more considered approach that prioritizes responsible and secure adoption. Fo r technology vendors, this means that building trust through transparency and embedding robust security features into their offerings is no longer a differentiator but a fundamental expectation.

## Emerging technologies being evaluated or piloted

Beyond established priorities, manufacturers are actively exploring a range of emerging technologies:

- ● Digital Twins: This technology is gaining considerable traction for applications such as factory optimization, simulating complex production scenarios, predictive maintenance of assets, and even product design. 1 McKinsey research indicates that a majority of manufacturing executives now see practical, value - adding applications for digital twins in their production operations. 44 Accenture's survey found that 47% of factory managers envision digital operations twins as a key component of the 2040 factory. 4
- ●
- Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR): AR and VR are being utilized

to enhance digital experiences for both employees and customers. Applications include immersive training programs, guided maintenance and repair procedures, remote assistance for complex tasks, and virtual product demonstrations. 1 Notably, digital experience (DX) professionals in the manufacturing sector report using VR and Mixed Reality (MR) more frequently than their counterparts in other industries. 45

- ● Advanced Robotics (including Humanoid Robots): The adoption of advanced robotics, including collaborative robots (cobots) and increasingly, humanoid robots, is on the rise for tasks such as material handling, intricate assembly operations, quality inspection, and working in hazardous environments. 2 An example is BMW's partnership with Figure to deploy humanoid robots in its automotive manufacturing facilities. 27
- ● Platform Engineering: This trend involves the creation of internal self - service platforms designed to accelerate the delivery of applications and improve the productivity of developer teams. 13 Gartner anticipates that by 2026, four out of five software engineering companies will utilize such dedicated platform teams to develop composable applications. 13
- ● Quantum Technologies: While still largely in the theoretical and experimental stages for most manufacturing applications in 2025, quantum computing holds significant potential for breakthroughs in areas like materials science, complex process optimization, and drug discovery. A very high impact is expected by 2030. 27
- ● 5G Connectivity: A notable 42% of manufacturers are already leveraging 5G technology at the facility or network level. 3 The adoption of private 5G networks is increasing, driven by the need for low - latency, high -bandwidth, and secure connectivity for critical manufacturing applications. 27
- ● Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing): This technology continues to be used for rapid prototyping, producing custom parts and tools, and manufacturing complex geometric designs, offering greater flexibility and speed in product development and low -volume production. 1

## Regional Spotlight: Divergent technology adoption rates and priorities in NA, EMEA, APAC

Technology adoption in manufacturing exhibits distinct regional characteristics:

- ● APAC: This region is often a global trendsetter in technology adoption, not merely a fast follower. 38 It demonstrates leadership in areas like humanoid robotics (notably Japan and South Korea) and smart city technologies

(Singapore being a prime example). 38 There is particularly high adoption of Generative AI, used for applications such as content localization and visual asset creation across multilingual markets. 38  Key manufacturing hubs in countries like Vietnam and Thailand are seeing increased investments in IoT security solutions. 38 Synthetic data generation for AI training is also gaining significant momentum in China, India, and J apan. 38 Overall ICT output growth in APAC is projected at 6.7% for 20 24, substantially outpacing the global average, driven largely by investments in AI and digital technologies. 32

- ● EMEA (Europe):  The region possesses strong research capabilities in AI, digital twin technology, machine learning, and energy/environmental technologies, but faces persistent challenges in commercializing these innovations effectively. 8 There is a notable focus on energy -efficient computing solutions and broader sustainability initiatives. 41 ICT output growth in Europe is projected to be modest at 0.3% in 2024, though a rebound to around 3% is anticipated for 2025. 32 The adoption of technologies like polyfunctional robots is expected to be at a medium level by 2025, but with projections for very high adoption by 2030. 41
- ● North America (NA): Manufacturers in this region are often adopting a "back -to-basics" AI strategy, with a primary focus on internal operational improvements, enhancing workforce productivity, and leveraging analytics for better decision -making. 10 There is strong adoption of technologies aimed at improving supply chain resilience. 10 ICT output growth for North America is expected to be around 4.3% in 2024. 32 Specific sectors, like US chemicals production, are anticipated to benefit from state support for related industries such as semiconductors, batteries, and solar panels. 32

Gartner's analysis points to a "China +1" strategy influencing global supply chains, leading to more regionalized diversification approaches (e.g., "APAC for APAC," "Europe for Europe," "North America for North America") or increased localization and nearshoring of manufacturing operations. 12 This trend introduces greater complexity in defining manufacturing market priorities and shaping technology investment roadmaps for global companies.

These regional divergences in technology adoption are not merely about the pace of uptake, but also reflect differences in the type  of technologies prioritized and the primary drivers  behind these investments. APAC's often consumer -driven and government -supported leapfrogging in areas like GenAI and robotics contrasts with EMEA's more cautious, regulation -influenced (e.g., the EU Green Deal  8 ) and R&amp;Dintensive approach. 8 Meanwhile, North America's focus is frequently on operational resilience and productivity gains, often linked to strategic reshoring or nearshoring initiatives. 10 Technology vendors, therefore, require deeply nuanced regional strategies that extend beyond simple market size assessments to address these underlying drivers, innovation cultures, and policy landscapes. A global product or solution may necessitate very different go-to-market messaging, use-case highlighting, and partnership strategies in each region to achieve success.

## 3. Buyer Mindset by Role

Understanding the distinct priorities, risk perceptions, and value frameworks of different decision - makers and influencers within a manufacturing organization is critical for effective technology sales and marketing. The buying committee is often complex and involves a blend of IT, business, and operational stakeholders.

## How IT decision makers (ITDMs) typically approach technology evaluation and risk

IT decision-makers in the manufacturing sector play a crucial role in vetting and approving technology investments, with a strong focus on technical viability, security, and integration.

- ● Priorities: In many manufacturing organizations, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is more likely to have ownership of consumer -facing digital touchpoints compared to other industries where the CEO might hold this responsibility. 45 Core priorities for ITDMs include ensuring the security, scalability, and manageability of the overall IT infrastructure, as well as the reliable and efficient transmission of data and information across the enterprise. 43 Compliance with a growing array of regulatory requirements, particularly around data security and privacy, heavily influences their decision -making processes. 47  When evaluating new technologies, ITDMs scrutinize aspects such as seamless integration with existing enterprise systems  48 , compatibility with current infrastructure, and the level of technical expertise required for ongoing operation and maintenance. 48
- ● Risk Perception: ITDMs are acutely aware of and concerned by cybersecurity threats, including unauthorized access to systems, intellectual property theft,

and the potential for operational disruption caused by cyber incidents. 3 Challenges related to complex system integrations  24  and ensuring the long-term reliability and performance of new technology solutions are also significant risk factors. Forrester research indicates that while IT departments generally possess substantial autonomy in decision-making, their performance and speed can be impacted by external factors such as evolving compliance mandates, constraints on resource allocation, and dependencies on other departments. 47

- ● Gartner's Perspective: According to Gartner, it is vital for ITDMs to have a clear understanding of the strategic business value that IT delivers to the organization. They must also be able to assess how a specific technology purchase aligns with overarching enterprise goals, t he urgency of the need, and the specific "trigger" or event that initiated the purchasing consideration. 50

ITDMs often act as crucial gatekeepers, ensuring that any new technology not only meets business needs but also adheres to technical standards, security protocols, and can be effectively integrated into the existing technology landscape. Their endorsement  is typically essential for a technology purchase to proceed.

## How business decision makers (BDMs) / Line of Business (LOB) leaders frame goals, value, and buying criteria

Business decision-makers, including Line of Business (LOB) leaders and C-suite executives, are the primary budget holders and approach technology investments with a strong focus on strategic business impact and financial returns.

- ● Priorities: The core focus for BDMs is the achievement of tangible business outcomes. These include objectives such as reducing operational costs, expanding into new markets or customer segments, improving overall operational efficiency, increasing profitability, and enhancing long -term competitiveness. 51 They seek technology solutions that directly address specific, well - defined business problems, such as production bottlenecks, quality control issues, supply chain inefficiencies, or skills gaps. 51 Deloitte's 2025 Smart Manufacturing Survey found that operational benefits (cited by 49% of respondents) and financial benefits (44%) are the primary types of value sought from smart manufacturing initiatives. 3
- ● Value Perception: For BDMs, the value of technology is framed primarily in terms of measurable ROI, such as demonstrable revenue growth, quantifiable time savings, or significant cost reductions. 52 They also look for improvements in key performance indicators like productivity, product quality, and overall

competitive advantage. 1 It is  c rucia l that the  proposed technology clearly helps the organization execute on its strategic goals, whether at the enterprise, business unit, or specific initiative level. 50

- ● Buying Criteria: Technology solutions must have a clear and compelling link to the organization's strategic objectives. 52 BDMs prioritize solutions that offer operational flexibility, provide actionable insights for better decision - making, and can scale effectively as the business grows or market conditions change. 48 Forrester research underscores this, noting that firms achieving strong alignment between their business needs and their technology strategy tend to grow 2.4 times faster than their peers. 53

BDMs are less concerned with the intricate technical details of a solution and more focused on its strategic implications and its ability to deliver on business promises. They require a clear, compelling business case that justifies the investment.

## Any new or rising influencers in the buying process

The traditional buying committee in manufacturing is expanding, with several new or increasingly influential roles impacting technology decisions:

- ● ESG/Sustainability Leaders: These roles are rapidly gaining influence due to escalating regulatory pressures and growing market demand for sustainable and ethical business practices. 10 They evaluate technology based on its capacity to reduce environmental impact (e.g., emissions, energy use, waste), improve resource efficiency, ensure ethical sourcing, and support transparent ESG reporting. ESG reports are now scrutinized by a wide rang e of stakeholders, including investors, consumers, public influencers, and policymakers. 14 This makes ESG a core component of corporate strategy, elevating these leaders to key positions in procurement decisions for any technology that impacts sustainability metrics.
- ● Compliance Officers: With the increasing complexity of the regulatory landscape, compliance officers play a vital role in decisions related to data security, data privacy, industry - specific regulations (e.g., GxP in pharmaceuticals), and trade compliance. 15 Their approval is often a prerequisite for technology adoption, particularly for solutions handling sensitive data or impacting regulated processes.
- ● Data Leaders (e.g., Chief Data Officer, VP of Analytics): As manufacturing becomes an increasingly data -driven industry, executives responsible for data strategy, governance, quality, and analytics are playing a more significant role in

selecting technologies that manage, process, and leverage enterprise data assets. 6 Their focus is on ensuring data quality, accessibility, security, and the ability of the technology to enable the derivation of actionable insights.

- ● Chief Digital Officers (CDOs): While in some manufacturing contexts the CTO may own consumer digital experiences 45 , CDOs or equivalent roles focused on overarching digital transformation strategy can be key influencers for broader, strategic technology initiatives that span multiple business functions.
- ● Plant Engineers/Operations Managers: These individuals have significant and often decisive input on technologies deployed directly on the factory floor. Their primary concerns revolve around reliability, ease of use, maintainability, safety, and seamless integration with existing Operational Technology (OT) systems. 51 They are deeply concerned with the practical implementation of new technologies and their direct impact on daily production activities, uptime, and output. Their buy -in is absolutely critical for the successful adoption of shop -floor technologies, and the y value solutions that solve tangible, real -world production challenges.
- ● Procurement/Buyer - Planners:  This function is responsible for the strategic sourcing of materials and services, managing costs, ensuring supplier reliability, and negotiating contracts. 58 Increasingly, procurement teams evaluate vendors not only on traditional criteria like quality, cost, and delivery performance but also on their ESG performance and compliance. 15 Procurement is evolving from a purely cost -focused tactical function to a more strategic one, incorporating broader risk management and sustainability considerations.
- ● External Advisors/Consultants: A significant number of manufacturing buying teams-nearly three -quarters (72%) according to one 6Sense report -now engage external consultants or industry analysts to assist with complex technology purchasing decisions. 60 While these external advisors can provide valuable expertise and an objective perspective, their involvement can sometimes lead to longer decision cycles and larger, more complex buying groups. 60 These third parties can significantly shape the definition of requirements and the shortlisting of potential vendors.

The increasing complexity of the manufacturing buying committee, now encompassing diverse roles such as ESG officers and plant engineers alongside traditional IT and business leaders, necessitates a multi - threaded value proposition from technology vendors.  A singular message or benefit, such as cost savings alone, is often no longer sufficient. Solutions must demonstrate clear and relevant value across a wide spectrum of concerns, including sustainability impact, operational practicality and reliability, data integrity and security, and alignment with overall business strategy.

Furthermore, while ITDMs are crucial for technical validation (ensuring security, integration, and scalability) and BDMs ultimately control the budget and strategic direction, the "go/no-go" decision for many technologies intended for the shop floor increasingly rests on the buy-in of operational leaders like plant managers and engineers. These operational stakeholders prioritize practicality, reliability, ease of use, and seamless integration within the existing OT environment. Their concerns, if not adequately addressed, can effectively veto a technology solution that might otherwise appear strategically sound or technically elegant. The convergence of IT and OT means that successful technology adoption must satisfy the requirements and gain the confidence of stakeholders from both domains.

## General mindset: innovation - forward, risk - averse, efficiency - led, etc.

The prevailing mindset among manufacturing technology buyers can be characterized as:

- ● Efficiency - Led:  This is a primary and enduring driver. Manufacturers consistently seek technologies that can improve operational efficiency, reduce production costs, and boost overall productivity. 2
- ● Risk-Averse (Pragmatic Innovation): While there is an awareness of and interest in innovation 4 , many manufacturers, particularly observed in North America, tend to adopt a "back - to - basics" approach. They often favor proven applications of technology that solve immediate, well - understood problems rather than pursuing purely experimental or high - risk initiatives. 10 Operational risk is a major concern associated with smart manufacturing initiatives, cited by 65% of respondents in a Deloitte survey. 3
- ● Value - Driven:  Purchasing decisions are heavily influenced by the vendor's ability to demonstrate a clear, quantifiable ROI and tangible business value. 48
- ● Increasingly Data - Driven:  There is a discernible shift towards making decisions based on data and analytics rather than relying solely on historical practices or intuition. 2
- ● Resilience - Focused:  In the wake of recent global disruptions, there is a strong and growing emphasis on building greater resilience into both operations and supply chains. 9

Regional Spotlight: Cultural and structural impacts on decision

- making dynamics

## in NA, EMEA, APAC

Decision-making dynamics exhibit notable regional variations:

- ● APAC: Buying groups in the APAC region tend to be larger and more complex, with external stakeholders (such as consultants and partners) playing a more significant role in the decision - making process compared to other regions. 38 Buyers in APAC are often younger, digital -first, and increasingly AI -savvy. They are also more demanding, placing a higher priority on vendor values (such as DEI and ESG commitments) and expecting highly personalized engagement. 38 Brand loyalty is generally weaker in APAC; only 35% of buyers start their purchasing journey with a single vendor already in mind, compared to 45% in North America. 38 Cultural nuances are critically important and vary significantly across the region (e.g., the emphasis on harmony and indirect communication in Japan, the importance of "guanxi" or relationships in China, and the respect for hierarchy in India). 38
- ● North America: Buyers in North America often place a higher value on "ease of doing business" with vendors. 62 Buying groups in this region tend to be smaller; for instance, 43% of North American business buyers report making purchase decisions with no more than two people involved from a single department, a contrast to 29% in Europe and 35% in APAC who report su ch small, concentrated decision units. 62
- ● EMEA (Europe):  Buying groups in Europe are typically of moderate size when compared to North America and APAC. 62 Price sensitivity is a significant factor in purchasing decisions, similar to the North American market. 62 Decision-making processes can also be influenced by the fragmented market structure within Europe, with varying national regulations and business practices across different EU member states. 8

These regional differences in buying group size, composition, and cultural expectations -such as the larger, more externally -influenced buying circles in APAC versus the smaller, more internally -focused groups often found in North America -suggest that sales  engagement models and consensus -building strategies must be significantly adapted by region. In APAC, successfully navigating a wider and more diverse web of influencers and adhering to specific cultural expectations is key. In contrast, in North America,  a more direct approach that emphasizes ease of doing business and clearly communicates value to a more concentrated group of key decision-makers might prove more effective. This has profound implications for all stages of the sales process, from initial o utreach and relationship building to negotiation tactics and closing strategies. For example, the importance of "guanxi" in China necessitates a different approach to building relationships than might be typical in more transactional Western markets. Similarly, the higher demand for demonstrated "values" like DEI and ESG from the younger demographic of APAC buyers needs to be factored into early-stage engagement and brand messaging.

The following table outlines the roles, priorities, and influence of key members within a typical manufacturing technology buying committee:

## 4. Messaging and Content Preferences

To effectively engage B2B technology buyers in the manufacturing sector, vendors must craft compelling narratives and deliver valuable content through preferred channels, attuned to the specific needs and mindset of this audience.

## Narrative tones and angles that resonate

The most successful messaging strategies adopt the following characteristics:

- ● Value - Driven &amp; Outcome - Focused:  Communications must clearly and concisely articulate the tangible business value and measurable outcomes that the technology solution will deliver. This involves directly linking product capabilities to key buyer priorities such as cost reduction, efficie ncy gains, quality improvements, and enhanced competitiveness. 50 The emphasis should always be on the benefits the buyer will realize, rather than merely listing product features. 65
- ● Problem -Solving:  Content and messaging should directly address the specific industry challenges, operational pain points, and strategic concerns that manufacturers grapple with daily. 60 Effective content helps buyers to clearly define their problem statements and understand the root causes. 60
- ● Expert &amp; Authoritative: Vendors should strive to position their brand as a knowledgeable thought leader and a trusted advisor within the manufacturing industry. This can be achieved by sharing deep insights, offering practical advice, and demonstrating a thorough understanding o f the sector's complexities. 66 Sharing counterintuitive insights that challenge conventional thinking and expose potential blind spots in a buyer's current approach can be particularly impactful. 60
- ● Clear, Direct, &amp; Simple: Given the often fast -paced and detail -oriented nature of manufacturing environments, communication should utilize straightforward language, avoid unnecessary technical jargon (or explain it clearly when unavoidable), and make complex technical information easily understandable for a diverse audience. 25
- ● Customer -Centric &amp; Empathetic: Messaging should demonstrate a genuine understanding of the buyer's unique needs, specific challenges, and their journey through the decision -making process. 68  This involves tailoring communications to resonate with their specific context and priorities.
- ● Compelling &amp; Forward - Looking:  Effective communication should go beyond simple status updates or product descriptions. It should aim to drive decisions and inspire future actions by clearly articulating key insights derived from data or experience, outlining concrete actions being take n or proposed, and providing a clear roadmap for future developments or value realization. 63

## Formats and types of proof that influence decisions

Manufacturing buyers rely on a variety of content formats and evidence types to inform their decisions:

- ● Case Studies &amp; Success Stories: These are highly effective for demonstrating the real-world application of a technology and showcasing measurable results achieved by other manufacturing companies. 66 For clients with sensitivity concerns, anonymous case studies can be a valuable tool. 72
- ● Product Demonstrations &amp; Videos: Visual content that shows products in action is crucial. Demos can effectively illustrate a solution's value and functionality, and videos can make complex machinery or software concepts more tangible and understandable for potential buyers. 66
- ● ROI Calculators &amp; Interactive Tools: Tools that allow buyers to quantify the potential benefits, calculate expected ROI, or visualize how a solution might work in their specific environment are highly influential. 48
- ● White Papers &amp; eBooks: In- depth content formats like white papers and eBooks are valuable for providing detailed information, thoroughly addressing complex industry challenges, and showcasing a vendor's expertise and thought leadership. 66
- ● Technical Documentation &amp; Guides: Comprehensive and accurate technical documentation, including specifications, integration guides, and user manuals, is essential for engineers and other technical evaluators within the buying committee. 66  Step-by-step guides, clear diagrams, and glossaries of technical terms can significantly simplify complex topics. 66
- ● Webinars:  Live or on-demand webinars offer an excellent platform to demonstrate products, answer specific questions from potential buyers in real -time, showcase expertise on relevant topics, and build direct engagement with the audience. 66
- ● Peer Reviews &amp; Testimonials: Authentic feedback from existing customers and industry peers carries significant weight and helps build trust and credibility. Buyers often trust the experiences of their peers more than direct marketing messages. 68  Maintaining a strong presence and positive reviews on third - party platforms like G2 and TrustRadius is increasingly important, especially as these sites are often prioritized by AI research tools. 74
- ● Analyst Reports: Independent validation and positive ratings from credible third - party industry analyst firms (e.g., Gartner, Forrester, IDC) are highly influential in shaping buyer perceptions and shortlisting decisions. 60
- ● Blog Posts:  Regularly published blog posts are effective for improving search

engine optimization (SEO), sharing timely industry news, providing company updates, and offering practical tips and insights that position the brand as an authority. 66

- ● Personalized Consultations: Offering one -on-one consultations allows vendors to address a buyer's specific needs and questions in detail, which can be a powerful tool for building rapport and advancing sales opportunities. 66

The most effective content strategies for manufacturing buyers often serve a dual purpose. Firstly, they educate the audience on how to understand and solve their complex operational or strategic problems, often through thought leadership pieces like white papers, insightful blog posts, and educational webinars. Secondly, they provide tangible, credible proof of a specific vendor's solution efficacy through compelling case studies, live product demonstrations, and verifiable ROI calculators. This blend of b road industry education and specific solution validation is crucial for engaging a results -oriented audience that is often inherently skeptical of marketing claims and requires robust evidence before committing to significant technology investments.

## Common metaphors, language, or frameworks used by buyers

Manufacturing buyers often use specific terminology and conceptual frameworks when discussing their needs and evaluating solutions:

- ● "Factory of the Future," "Smart Manufacturing," "Industry 4.0": These are widely recognized and frequently used terms to describe the ongoing digital transformation and modernization efforts within the sector. 1
- ● "Efficiency," "Productivity," "Optimization": This is core operational language, reflecting the constant drive for improved performance and resource utilization. 1
- ● "Resilience," "Agility": These terms have gained significant prominence, particularly in discussions related to supply chain management and the ability of manufacturing operations to adapt to market changes and disruptions. 9
- ● "Data - Driven Decision Making": This phrase reflects the increasing emphasis on leveraging data analytics and business intelligence to inform strategic and operational choices. 2
- ● Frameworks for Evaluation: Buyers, particularly in more structured organizations, may utilize formal decision - making frameworks, such as decision matrices or weighted scoring models, to evaluate and compare different technology options and vendors. 51 For vendors, understanding frameworks like the "5Cs" of executive communication (Connection, Clarity, Concise, Compelling,

Consistency) can be beneficial in structuring their own messaging. 63

## Common messaging mistakes or overused tropes that fail in this industry

Vendors can undermine their efforts by falling into common messaging traps:

- ● Overly Technical Jargon Without Explanation: Using highly technical terms without providing clear explanations can alienate non - technical decision -makers (such as BDMs or finance leaders) and even obscure the core value proposition for technical audiences if the context is missing. 25
- ● Focusing on Features, Not Benefits/Outcomes: Manufacturing buyers are primarily interested in understanding "what's in it for them" and how a product or service will solve their specific problems or help them achieve their goals. A feature -led approach often fails to connect with these core needs. 63
- ● Generic, One -Size-Fits -All Messaging: The manufacturing sector is diverse, with distinct sub -sectors and varied buyer roles. Generic B2B messaging that is not tailored to the specific context, challenges, and language of the target manufacturing audience will likely fail to resonate. 63 Tailored and personalized messages are key. 63
- ● Lack of Clear ROI or Business Case: Given the often significant investment involved in new technologies, decisions are heavily scrutinized for their financial impact. Messaging that fails to provide a clear, quantifiable ROI or a compelling business case is unlikely to gain traction with bu dget holders. 48
- ● Ignoring the Complexity of the Buying Committee: Crafting messages that only target one type of decision - maker (e.g., focusing solely on IT benefits without addressing operational or financial implications) will likely prove ineffective given the multi - stakeholder nature of manufacturing procurement. 68
- ● Not Providing Sufficient Tangible Proof Points: Claims about product capabilities or benefits need to be substantiated with credible evidence, such as detailed case studies, verifiable performance data, customer testimonials, and third - party validation. 68
- ● Inconsistent Messaging Across Platforms and Touchpoints: The B2B buyer's journey in manufacturing is typically long and involves multiple interactions across various channels. Inconsistent messaging can create confusion, erode trust, and undermine the overall brand perception. 68

Given the significant rise in independent buyer research 60 and the increasing use of Generative AI tools by buyers for initial information gathering 74 , the nature and accessibility of vendor content have become paramount. Content must not only be informative and persuasive to human readers but also easily discoverable through search engines (requiring strong SEO practices  66 ) and structured in a way that provides clear, concise answers that AI algorithms can effectively parse and surface to users. As one source advises, "Being present to showcase value is critical"  74 , and this presence now extends to being visible and understandable to AI-powered research assistants. Vendors should actively audit their product's visibility and representation within these emerging AI-driven tools. 74

The strong and persistent preference for peer validation (through testimonials and reviews  68 ) and the significant influence of industry analyst insights  60 in a traditionally risk- averse sector like manufacturing carry important implications. It suggests that internal marketing content, regardless of how well-crafted it may be, often needs to be augmented and reinforced by credible, external voices to build the necessary trust and overcome inherent skepticism, especially when dealing with high-stakes technology investments. This points towards the necessity of an integrated marketing strategy that actively cultivates customer advocacy programs and engages strategically with relevant industry analysts to amplify key messages and lend thirdparty credibility to vendor claims.

## Regional Spotlight: Content format and language preferences in NA, EMEA, APAC

While detailed regional preferences for specific content formats  are not extensively covered in the provided research beyond general trends, the need for localized content  and culturally attuned communication is particularly evident for the APAC region:

- ● APAC: Buyers in this region are noted to be younger and digital - first, expecting seamless digital experiences and highly personalized engagement. 38 Generative AI is already being used by these buyers for research purposes. 61 Crucially, due to the vast cultural diversity across APAC countries, the localization of messaging, including language and cultural references, along with culturally intelligent sales approaches, is critical for success. 61
- ● General B2B Trends: More broadly, Forrester research indicates that two - thirds of today's B2B buyers were born after 1980 and have come to expect fast, intuitive, and self - serve buying experiences, akin to their B2C interactions. 70 A high percentage (81%) of B2B buyers expressed dissatisfaction with the winning provider in a recent B2B purchase, signaling a widespread need for improved buyer experiences across all regions. 70

## 5. Buying Journey &amp; Channel Behavior

The B2B technology buying journey in the manufacturing sector is characterized by extensive independent research, reliance on diverse information channels, and often lengthy, consensus -driven decision -making processes.

## Where and how buyers research, validate, and compare solutions

Manufacturing technology buyers employ a multi - faceted approach to gather information and evaluate potential solutions:

- ● Independent Research: A defining characteristic of the modern B2B buyer is the significant amount of time spent on independent research before ever engaging with a sales representative. Some studies suggest this can be as much as 83% of

their journey 74 or 45% according to Gartner. 76  Furthermore, 97% of buyers report checking vendor websites prior to any direct engagement. 60  This underscores the critical importance of a vendor's digital presence, as initial shortlisting or even elimination can occur based solely on independently accessed information.

- ● Online Channels: Key online resources include search engines (making Search Engine Optimization crucial for visibility 66 ), vendor websites (which serve as primary information hubs 60 ), industry - specific forums (for niche discussions and peer insights 66 ), and professional social media platforms, particularly LinkedIn for B2B networking and information discovery. 66
- ● Generative AI Tools: The use of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT for research is rapidly becoming mainstream, with some reports indicating up to 90% of B2B buyers leveraging such tools. 70 These AI assistants are reshaping the early and middle stages of the buyer's journey by synthesizing information and providing summaries. 74  Consequently, vendor content needs to be structured and optimized for discoverability and comprehension by these AI tools. 74

## ● Validation Sources:

- ○ Industry Analysts: Reports and consultations from reputable industry analyst firms (e.g., Gartner, Forrester, IDC) are highly influential in shaping perceptions and guiding decisions. 60 Indeed, 72% of buying teams engage consultants or analysts to assist with purchasing decisions. 60
- ○ Peer Networks &amp; Recommendations: These are extremely important sources of validation. Buyers often place greater trust in the experiences and recommendations of their industry peers than in direct marketing messages from vendors. 72 Strong peer advocacy can even contribute to shortening decision cycles. 72
- ○ Third - Party Review Sites: Platforms such as G2 and TrustRadius are increasingly consulted by buyers and are also prioritized by AI research tools when sourcing vendor information and reviews. 74
- ● Comparison Methods: To compare solutions, buyers utilize various resources including product comparison sheets (often provided by vendors or compiled independently 67 ), interactive online tools like ROI calculators or product configurators/visualizers 64 , and direct vendor -owned interactions such as discussions with product experts or participation in free trials and detailed demonstrations. 62

The increasing preference of buyers for self - service and extensive independent research, now augmented by the use of Generative AI as a research assistant, means that a vendor's comprehensive "digital storefront" -encompassing their website, depth and quality of content, availability of online tools, and presence on third - party review platforms-is becoming the primary arena for early-stage buyer engagement and qualification. A failure to provide comprehensive, easily digestible, and AIdiscoverable information through these digital channels can lead to premature disqualification from consideration, often before any direct sales interaction has occurred.

## Role of analysts, events, partners, or peer networks

Various external entities play significant roles in the manufacturing technology buying journey:

- ● Industry Analysts: As noted, analysts exert considerable influence on buyer awareness, vendor shortlisting, and final selection processes. 60 Data from related technology sectors indicates that analysts are involved in over half of all deals. 75
- ● Events (Industry Conferences, Trade Shows): These have historically been important channels for lead generation, networking, product discovery, and direct interaction with vendors. 77 Buyers report deriving significant value from vendor-owned interactions at such events, including discussions with product experts and live demonstrations. 62
- ● Partners (e.g., System Integrators, Resellers, Consultants): Channel partners can significantly influence technology decisions, especially for complex solutions that require specialized integration expertise, customized deployment, or ongoing local support. Their role is implicit in effective go - to - market strategie s. 69
- ● Peer Networks: These are crucial for informal advice, candid recommendations, and the validation of vendor claims and solutions. 72 The trust placed in peer experiences often outweighs formal marketing communications.

## Common sales cycle patterns: fast/slow, consensus - driven, RFP-heavy, etc.

The sales cycle for technology in the manufacturing sector typically exhibits several distinct characteristics:

- ● Slow &amp; Complex: The average B2B sales cycle is often cited as around 102 days. 68 However, for the manufacturing industry, this can extend to approximately 130 days from initial contact to deal closure. 72 Some research, such as that by Dentsu, suggests an even longer timeline, averaging 379 days from the point a buyer begins initial research into a pain point to when a deal is finally agreed upon. 72 This extended duration is attributable to the complexity of the products and solutions being purchased, the often high investment values

involved, and the need for extensive internal alignment and approvals within the buying organization.

- ● Consensus -Driven:  Decisions are rarely made by a single individual. Buying committees are common and often comprise a large and diverse group of stakeholders from various departments. 60 In the APAC region, these buying groups tend to be even larger and more complex. 38 Achieving consensus among all relevant parties is a distinct and often challenging "buying job" that must be completed before a purchase can proceed. 64 Sales efforts must, therefore, focus on identifying all key stakeholders and building consensus across their varied priorities and concerns.
- ● RFP-Heavy:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) process is a common component of procurement for large, complex technology investments, particularly within established manufacturing enterprises. This is an implicit consequence of the high value, complexity, and risk assoc iated with such purchases.
- ● Buyer -Controlled Engagement: Buyers are increasingly in control of the engagement timeline. They often initiate direct contact with vendors only after conducting a significant amount of independent research -sometimes as much as 69% of the way through their decision - making journey. 60 A substantial majority (85%) have largely established their purchase requirements before any formal contact with sellers. 60 This dynamic means that sellers must find ways to influence potential buyers before  direct contact is made, primarily through valuable and easily accessible online content.

## Where in the journey decisions stall or accelerate

Understanding the common friction points and acceleration levers in the manufacturing sales cycle is crucial for vendors:

## ● Stalling Points:

- ○ Budget Crunches &amp; Price Sensitivity: Financial constraints and price sensitivity are major factors that can derail or delay purchasing decisions, especially in times of macroeconomic uncertainty. 62 In the APAC region, cost often becomes a primary concern when deals encounter stalls, even if it wasn't the top initial factor. 38
- ○ Inability to Build Internal Consensus: Difficulty in getting all key stakeholders within the buying organization to agree on a particular solution or vendor is a frequent cause of delay. This is particularly cited as a challenge by younger buyers  62  and is recognized as one of the six key "buying jobs". 64
- ○ Information Overload &amp; Complexity:

The sheer volume of information available and the inherent complexity of many technology solutions can overwhelm buyers, making the decision-making process more difficult and protracted than ever before. 62  Buyers often face too many choices and navigate muddled internal buying processes. 71

- ○ Lack of Clear Value/ROI: If the benefits of a proposed solution are not clearly articulated and quantified in terms of tangible ROI, the business case will be weak, leading to hesitation or rejection. 48
- ○ Technical Complexity &amp; Integration Concerns: Worries about the technical difficulty of implementing a new solution or integrating it with existing legacy systems can be significant roadblocks. 71
- ○ Misalignment During Discovery: A failure to accurately understand and align with the buyer's true needs and priorities during the initial discovery phase can lead to proposals that miss the mark and ultimately kill deals. 60

## ● Acceleration Levers:

- ○ Strong Peer Advocacy: Positive recommendations and advocacy from trusted industry peers can significantly shorten the decision cycle, potentially by as much as 11 weeks. 2 7
- ○ Streamlined Negotiation &amp; Contracting: An efficient and transparent negotiation and contracting process can also cut considerable time from the sales cycle, again potentially by around 11 weeks. 72  The use of digital tools such as e-signatures and dedicated digital "sales rooms" for sharing documents and collaborating can help facilitate this. 72
- ○ Clear Value Proposition &amp; Quantified ROI: A compelling and well supported articulation of the solution's value and expected ROI is a powerful accelerator. 50
- ○ Supplier - Provided Digital Tools &amp; Sales Rep Partnership: B2B buyers are reported to be 1.8 times more likely to complete a high - quality deal (one that meets their expectations without undue compromise) when they utilize supplier-provided digital tools in conjunction with a sales representative, rather than usin g those tools independently. 64
- ○ Helping Buyers Quantify Benefits &amp; Feel in Control: Providing tools and information that help buyers quantify the benefits for their specific organization and make them feel confident and in control of the purchase decision can accelerate the process. 64
- ○ Strong Human Interaction with the Brand: Meaningful, one -to-one human interactions with knowledgeable brand representatives during the purchase process can save up to 9 weeks in the cycle. 72
- ○ Effective Engagement with Procurement: Proactive and well -managed engagement with the buyer's procurement function can shorten the final stages of a deal by as much as 4 weeks. 72

While digital channels are undeniably crucial for research and initial engagement, the available data suggests that for complex B2B manufacturing technology purchases, a purely "rep -free" experience is often suboptimal and can even lead to higher rates of purchase regret. 64 The most effective buyer journeys typically blend the convenience and efficiency of digital self - service with strategic, value -added human interaction. This hybrid approach is particularly important for validating complex solutions, building buyer confide nce, and helping navigate the challenging process of achieving internal consensus within the buying organization.

The common stalling points in the manufacturing sales cycle -typically related to budget approval, achieving internal consensus among diverse stakeholders, and managing information overload 62 -are often exacerbated by the inherent complexity of the technology solutions being sold and the varied, sometimes conflicting, needs of the large buying committees involved. This implies that technology vendors who can effectively act as "simplifiers" and "consensus-builders" will hold a significant advantage. This involves providing exceptionally clear ROI justification, offering tools and content specifically designed to facilitate internal alignment within the buyer's organization, and tailoring informa tion to the distinct perspectives of different stakeholders. By helping the buyer to buy, vendors can accelerate deals and reduce the likelihood of them stalling indefinitely.

## Regional Spotlight: Variations in channel engagement and sales cycle characteristics in NA, EMEA, APAC

Channel engagement preferences and sales cycle dynamics show notable regional differences:

- ● APAC: Buyers in the Asia-Pacific region tend to place a greater emphasis on trust, the perceived expertise of the provider, and the quality of their relationships with vendors when making purchasing decisions. 62 As previously noted, buying groups are generally larger and involve more external influencers. 38 While price may not be the top initial factor, it often becomes a major concern if deals encounter stalls or delays. 38
- ● North America: Buyers in this region often prioritize "ease of doing business" with vendors. 62 Buying groups tend to be smaller and more concentrated, with

43% of business buyers making purchase decisions with no more than two people from a single department, compared to significantly lower percentages in Europe (29%) and APAC (35%). 62  Price sensitivity is generally high among North American buyers. 62

- ● EMEA: Price sensitivity is also a prominent factor for buyers in Europe, similar to North America. 62  The size of buying groups is typically moderate, falling between the patterns seen in North America and APAC. 62
- ● General B2B Digital Preference: Across regions, there's a strong trend: 75% of B2B buyers indicate a preference for a rep - free sales experience. 64 However, a crucial counterpoint is that self - service digital purchases are also reported to be far more likely to result in post - purchase regret. 64 This suggests that while buyers value digital convenience, the absence of human guidance in complex purchases can lead to suboptimal outcomes. A hybrid approach, combining digital resources with human sales interaction, is often optimal. 64
- ○ Specifically for technology buyers, familiarity with the product influences channel preference. When buyers are already familiar with a product or service, 64% prefer a 100% digital buying experience, citing speed, convenience, and comfort. 64 Even in these cases, however, they still desire human interaction for asking questions, understanding future product directions, assessing intangible factors, and improving negotiation options. 64
- ○ Conversely, when technology buyers are unfamiliar with a product or service, the desire for human assistance is higher. They seek help to gain a better understanding of potential use cases, ask clarifying questions, receive personalized guidance or advice,  build a relationship with a potential new vendor, and consult with an expert. 64

## 6. Strategic Insights for Marketers

Targeting the manufacturing sector with technology solutions requires a nuanced and well-informed marketing approach. Understanding the specific mindset, priorities, and buying behaviors prevalent in this industry is key to crafting strategies that resonate and drive results.

## Three key things marketers should remember when targeting this industry

Based on the comprehensive analysis of buyer behavior and industry trends, three overarching principles emerge for marketers:

- 1. Emphasize Demonstrable ROI and Tangible Business Outcomes:
- Manufacturing buyers are inherently pragmatic and focused on results. Marketing messages and content must go beyond features and functions to clearly articulate how a technology solution will solve specific operational problems, improve efficiency, reduce costs, enhance product quality, or contribute to strategic imperatives like sustainability and supply chain resilience. 48 As Gartner advises, marketers should "help buyers quantify the benefits" of a product or service. 64 This aligns with the expectation from decision-makers that solutions directly connect to their strategic goals. 52 The pressure for financial justification is significant, with G2 data (via Corporate Visions) indicating that 78% of buyers expect to see ROI within six months of implementing new software. 60
- 2. Cater to a Diverse and Evolving Buying Committee: Technology purchasing decisions in manufacturing are rarely made by a single individual. Marketers must recognize and address the varied perspectives of a complex buying committee that typically includes IT decision - makers, business line leaders, operatio ns managers, engineers, procurement specialists, and increasingly, ESG and data governance leaders. 14  Messaging and content must be tailored to resonate with

the unique priorities, pain points, and evaluation criteria of each key stakeholder. As 6Sense data (via Corporate Visions) suggests, it's crucial to "help sellers map out who's involved in buying decisions and every stakeholder's priorities". 60  The complexity is further amplified by the fact that nearly three-quarters (72%) of buying teams now engage external consultants or analysts  60 , and in regions like APAC, buying groups are the largest globally. 38

- 3. Invest in a Comprehensive Digital Presence that Facilitates Independent Buyer Research: Manufacturing buyers conduct extensive online research long before they engage directly with vendors. 60 Therefore, a robust and informative digital presence is non -negotiable. This includes a well -designed, intuitive website hosting high -quality, educational content such as blog posts, white papers, detailed case studies, product demonstrations, and interac tive comparison tools. 66 This content must be easily discoverable via search engines (SEO) and, increasingly, by Generative AI research tools, to exert influence in the critical early stages of the buyer's journey. As Corporate Visions advises, marketers should "create content th at influences buyers early in their purchasing journey" and "equip sellers with insights buyers can't just Google". 60 This is vital when considering that buyers may be as far as 69% through their journey before initiating vendor contact, and 97% will have already checked vendor websites. 60

Effective marketing to the manufacturing sector necessitates a "bilingual" communication capability. Marketers must be adept at speaking the language of strategic business value -articulating ROI, competitive advantage, and market share implications -to resonate with BDMs and C-suite executives. Simultaneously, they must proficiently communicate in the language of operational reality and technical feasibility -addressing reliability, integration, uptime, and specific process improvements -to gain the confidence  of ITDMs, engineers, and plant managers. Many common marketing pitfalls in this sector stem from a failure to effectively bridge this communication gap, highlighting the need to translate product features into both strategic benefits and tangible operatio nal advantages.

## Common pitfalls to avoid when adapting messaging from other sectors

Adapting marketing strategies from other B2B sectors to manufacturing without careful consideration can lead to significant missteps:

- ● Underestimating Technical Depth &amp; Specificity: The manufacturing industry has unique operational challenges, complex processes, and specific technical requirements. Generic B2B messaging often lacks the necessary depth, precision,

and industry - s p e c ific la nguage  to re sonate with experienced engineers, plant managers, or even ITDMs who are familiar with Operational Technology (OT) environments. 25  While jargon should be avoided or explained, a superficial understanding of the manufacturing context will be quickly apparent.

- ● Overlooking the Importance of Operational Impact: Unlike some software sales where benefits might be primarily financial or strategic, technology implemented in a manufacturing setting directly impacts physical processes, production uptime, product quality, and worker safety. Messaging must thoroughly ad dress these critical operational realities and potential impacts. 51
- ● Ignoring the Long, Complex, Consensus - Driven Sales Cycle: Sales tactics designed for faster, simpler decision - making processes common in other B2B sectors (e.g., high -pressure closing techniques, focusing on a single decision -maker) are likely to fail in manufacturing. The industry is characterized by extended sales cycles and the need for broad internal consensus. Patience, diligent relationship -building across the buying committee, and strategies that facilitate consensus are paramount. 60
- ● Not Addressing Legacy System Integration: Many manufacturers operate with a heterogeneous technology landscape, often comprising a mix of older legacy systems and newer technologies. Solutions that can effectively integrate with or strategically modernize these existing systems are often preferre d over "rip -andreplace" approaches, which might be more common in industries with less physical infrastructure entanglement. 24
- ● Failing to Provide Sufficient Tangible Proof and Validation: While case studies and testimonials are standard in B2B marketing, the manufacturing sector often demands exceptionally concrete and verifiable proof of performance, reliability, and ROI. This is due to the capital -intensive nature of many technology investments and their direct, often high - stakes, impact on production output and operational stability. 66
- ● Not Localizing for Regional Manufacturing Nuances and Priorities: Assuming a monolithic global manufacturing mindset is a frequent error. As highlighted throughout this analysis, key priorities (e.g., energy costs in EMEA 8 ), technology adoption rates, buying group dynamics, and even fundamental economic challenges vary significantly by region (North America, EMEA, APAC). 10 Messaging and go-to-market strategies must be carefully localized to reflect these critical regional differences.

In an industry characterized by long sales cycles and a high degree of independent buyer research, the role of marketing extends far beyond traditional lead generation.

It must evolve into active "deal acceleration" and "consensus facilitation." This means creating marketing assets and sales enablement tools specifically designed to help internal champions within the buying organization navigate complex internal approval processes, effectively justify the investment to diverse stakeholders, and de-risk the decision throughout the protracted buyer's journey. This represents a strategic shift from merely "marketing to buyers" to "marketing through  buyers" by empowering them with the resources they need to sell the solution internally.

Furthermore, the increasing influence of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors and sustainability considerations 10 is not just a superficial messaging point but reflects a fundamental shift in how value is perceived and prioritized in the manufacturing sector. For marketers, this requires the authentic integration of sustainability narratives into the core value propo sition of their technology solutions, rather than treating ESG as an optional add - on or a separate marketing campaign. Technologies that can demonstrably contribute to a manufacturer's sustainability goals -be it reducing carbon footprint, minimizing waste, improving energy efficiency, or ensuring ethical supply chains -can gain a significant competitive edge. This appeals not only to ESG - focused leaders but also to a broader range of stakeholders, including investors, customers, and a new generation of talen t who prioritize corporate responsibility.

## Conclusion

The B2B technology buying landscape in the manufacturing sector is complex and rapidly evolving, shaped by powerful forces such as Industry 4.0, economic volatility, supply chain imperatives, sustainability demands, and persistent talent challenges. Technology providers seeking to succeed in this environment must adopt a deeply informed and strategically nuanced approach.

Key takeaways indicate that manufacturing buyers are increasingly sophisticated, conducting extensive independent research and leveraging a diverse range of information channels, including peer networks, industry analysts, and emerging AI -powered tools. De cision-making is a collaborative, consensus -driven process involving an expanding committee of stakeholders with varied priorities -from IT's focus on security and integration, to business leaders' demand for ROI, and operational teams' concern for practica lity and reliability on the shop floor. ESG considerations are no longer peripheral but are becoming integral to procurement criteria.

Globally, while the drive for smart manufacturing and AI adoption is strong, regional differences in technology priorities, adoption maturity, and buying behaviors are significant. APAC often leads in embracing emerging technologies with strong government backing, EMEA grapples with energy costs and R&amp;D commercialization while prioritizing sustainability, and North America focuses on operational resilience and productivity, often linked to reshoring efforts.

For technology marketers, this landscape demands a multi-faceted strategy:

- ● Value Articulation: Messaging must be laser-focused on tangible business outcomes and demonstrable ROI, tailored to the specific pain points and strategic goals of manufacturers.
- ● Stakeholder Engagement: Content and communication must cater to the diverse needs of the entire buying committee, addressing technical, operational, financial, and sustainability concerns.
- ● Digital Dominance: A comprehensive, high -quality digital presence is crucial for influencing buyers during their extensive independent research phase. Content must be educational, easily discoverable (including by AI), and provide credible proof points.
- ● Hybrid Sales Approach: While digital self - service is preferred for initial research, complex manufacturing technology sales benefit from a hybrid approach that strategically integrates human expertise for validation, consensus -building, and navigating complexity.
- ● Regional Acuity: Go-to-market strategies, messaging, and even product positioning must be adapted to the distinct economic conditions, innovation cultures, regulatory environments, and buyer behaviors of North America, EMEA, and APAC.

Ultimately, vendors who can act as trusted partners -simplifying complexity, facilitating consensus, demonstrating clear value across multiple dimensions, and understanding the unique context of the manufacturing industry and its sub -sectors -will be best po sitioned to build lasting relationships and achieve sustained success in this dynamic market.
