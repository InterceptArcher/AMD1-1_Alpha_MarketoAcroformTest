## Navigating B2B Technology Procurement in the Consumer Goods Sector: A Global Analysis of Buyer Behavior, Priorities, and Messaging

## 1. Industry Context

The Consumer Goods (CG) sector, encompassing a wide array of products including food and beverage, household goods, personal care, and apparel, is currently navigating a period of significant transformation and economic recalibration. 1 Globally, the industry has experienced slower sales growth in 2024, estimated at 7.5% year-over-year, down from 9.3% in 2023 and 9.8% in 2022, primarily due to the waning effects of price increases with only modest volume gains. 3 This slowdown reflects an environment where consumers are increasingly empowered and price -sensitive, grappling with higher living costs, socio - political tensions, and in some cases, growing brand distrust. 5 In developed markets like the US and EU, where prices in late 2024 were over 20% higher than early 2020 levels, sales growth dropped to 4.5% in 2024 from 7.7% in 2023, with flat volumes. 3 Bain's Consumer Lab surveys indicate that approximately 80% of US and European consumers are cutting spending due to cost -of-living concerns. 3 Conversely, emerging markets remain the primary growth engine, posting an 11% year-over-year increase in retail sales value and accounting for almost all global volume growth (3%) in 2024. 3

Consumer goods companies face a confluence of challenges. Persistent inflation affects both consumer spending and corporate costs. 7 Supply chain volatility, exacerbated by geopolitical events like the Red Sea Crisis and the Russia -Ukraine War, continues to disrupt operations and pressure margins. 6 The Red Sea Crisis alone disrupted an estimated $6 billion in weekly trade flows and increased supply chain lead times by 35%. 8  Evolving consumer preferences, including a shift away from mass-market offerings towards niche or "better for you" brands, demand greater agility and innovation. 3 Insurgent brands are capturing a significant share of growth, for instance, about 40% of total US consumer product growth in the first half of 2024 was attributed to these smaller players. 3 Furthermore, mounting regulatory pressures, particularly concerning product safety, labeling, environmental sustainability (ESG), and data privacy, add layers of complexity. 1 For example, increased PFAS reporting requirements and new rules for Unique Formula Identifiers (UFIs) on industrial mixtures came into effect in 2024. 9

Amidst these challenges, key transformation drivers are reshaping the industry.

Digitalization is paramount, with companies investing in technology to enhance customer experiences, optimize operations, and gain competitive advantages. 6 Sustainability has moved from a niche concern to a core business imperative, driven by consumer demand and regulatory mandates. 9  Personalization is also a critical driver, with 80 % of consumers more likely to purchase from brands offering tailored experiences, according to Gartner. 5  Deloitte's 20 24 Consumer Products Industry Outlook suggests that if price increases have run their course, companies must pivot to "profitable volume," which involves carefully growing volume with an innovative and more profitable product mix while retaining pricing where practical. 1  This new playbook requires a focus on targeted advertising, precision growth management, strategic M&amp;A, a rebalanced product mix, strategic innovation, and enhanced operations and supply chains. 1

## 2. Technology Investment Priorities

Consumer Goods (CG) companies are strategically channeling investments into modernizing their IT systems across the entire value chain to navigate the complex market landscape and unlock new growth avenues. 11 The technology agenda is increasingly shaped by the imperative to enhance efficiency, personalize customer experiences, foster innovation, ensure compliance, and build resilient supply chains.

## Key Technology Trends and Investments

Several dominant technology trends are at the forefront of investment for CG companies between 2023 and 2025:

- ● Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Generative AI (GenAI), Applied AI, and Machine Learning (ML):
- ○ AI has rapidly ascended as a transformative force. Accenture's Pulse of Change Index identified technology, catapulted by GenAI, as the number one cause of business change in 2023, a significant jump from its sixth position in 2022. Notably, 76% of C-suite executives perceive GenAI more as an opportunity than a threat. 15
- ○ McKinsey's 2024 Technology Trends Outlook echoes this, pinpointing GenAI, Applied AI, and Industrializing Machine Learning as pivotal trends directly impacting the CG sector. 16 The economic potential is vast, with GenAI use cases projected to generate $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in annual value across industries, and 65% of organizations already reporting regular GenAI use in at least one business function. 16
- ○ Deloitte also acknowledges GenAI as a "newer challenge" and a significant

opportunity for CG leaders. 1 Forrester forecasts that global investments in GenAI software will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% between 2023 and 2030, reaching $227 billion. 19

- ○ Within the CG sector, AI applications are diverse, including personalizing customer experiences  11 , driving product innovation and reformulation  20 , optimizing supply chains, creating marketing content  22 , and powering customer service chatbots. 16
- ○ However, a noteworthy gap exists. While general business leaders are enthusiastic about GenAI's potential  15 , Bain &amp; Company's research reveals that only 37% of CPG executives rank AI among their top five priorities, and a mere 6% have a concrete plan for leveraging AI to create business value. 3 This disparity suggests a critical execution gap. CPG executives, traditionally focused on operational efficiency and brand management, may find it challenging to translate the broad potential of AI into specific, valuegenerating use cases for their industry. The historically slower technology adoption cycles in CPG compared to sectors like finance or high tech might also contribute to this lag. Consequently, technology vendors need to articulate very clear, CPG-specific business cases and ROI for AI solutions to bridge this gap.

## ● Data and AI -Driven Retailing / Analytics:

- ○ IDC identifies "Data and AI -driven retailing" as a crucial trend for the Americas Food, Grocery, and Convenience Stores/Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sub-sector in 2024. 13
- ○ The ability to analyze consumer sentiment and behavior through data is essential, particularly in an inflationary environment where understanding price sensitivity and evolving perceptions is key to maintaining loyalty. 6
- ○ IDC further emphasizes that leading retail and CPG firms are using analytics and AI to transform operations, improve decision - making, and offer seamless omnichannel customer experiences. 23
- ○ Given that CPG companies often have limited direct access to first - party data (as they primarily sell through retailers), Forrester notes their priority is to leverage external data sources to enrich their understanding of customers and prospects. 24

## ● Cloud Computing:

- ○ Strategic investments in IT modernization heavily feature cloud technologies as key enablers across the value chain. 11
- ○ Industry Cloud Platforms are highlighted by Gartner as a 2024 trend, offering

tailored solutions for Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Customer Data Platforms (CDP), supply chain management, and other critical functions. 25

- ○ The demand for cloud services remains robust, with major providers reporting significant revenue growth, underscoring its foundational role in digital transformation. 19

## ● Supply Chain Optimization Technologies:

- ○ A connected supply chain with enhanced inventory visibility is a top priority. 13
- ○ IDC's analysis of the NRF 2024 Big Show pointed to a strong focus on returns management, product life -cycle management, advanced tracking and tracing, and achieving end -to-end visibility across omnichannel supply chains. 26
- ○ Gartner advises Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) to invest aggressively in advanced visibility solutions and to build diversified, resilient networks. 27
- ○ AI-powered tools for demand forecasting are becoming indispensable for managing volatile demand and minimizing waste. 28

## ● E-commerce and Omnichannel Platforms:

- ○ The concept of a "connected omni - channel store" is a key investment area. 13
- ○ CG companies are investing in digital commerce capabilities leveraging AI/ML, cloud, IoT, and automation to create seamless customer journeys. 11
- ○ IDC's research on "Experiential Retail" highlights use cases like "Experiential Commerce" and "Immersive Experience" as part of this trend. 30

## ● Sustainability Technology / Green ICT:

- ○ Operationalizing sustainability is a significant focus, driven by both regulatory pressures and consumer expectations. 26
- ○ Forrester identifies "green and digital innovation" as a key investment area for 2024. 19 McKinsey's technology trends also include "Electrification and renewables" and "Climate technologies beyond electrification and renewables" as directly affecting CPG. 16
- ○ This translates into demand for technologies that support ESG data tracking, carbon management, regulatory compliance, and transparent reporting. 31 The push for sustainability is not merely an environmental initiative; it is evolving into a data and compliance imperative. Regulatory bodies are increasingly mandating stringent ESG reporting 9 , and consumers are actively seeking sustainable products. 14 To meet these dual demands, companies must collect, analyze, and report extensive data across their value chains. 31 This inherently necessitates investment in technologies capable of managing this data

effectively and transparently, directly linking the sustainability trend to specific technology needs.

## Drivers for Technology Adoption

The primary motivations for these technology investments include:

- ● Efficiency and Cost Optimization: Streamlining operations, automating routine tasks, and reducing waste are perennial goals. 11
- ● Enhanced Customer Experience (CX): Delivering personalized interactions, creating seamless omnichannel journeys, and offering convenient self - service options are crucial for loyalty. 5 Gartner projects that by 2024, 85% of customer interactions will be managed without human intervention, underscoring the shift to digital and AI -driven engagement. 5
- ● Innovation and Growth: Technology is seen as an enabler for developing new products, entering new markets, and creating novel revenue streams. 1
- ● Compliance and Risk Management: Meeting evolving regulatory requirements (especially around ESG and product safety) and ensuring robust data security are key drivers. 9
- ● Supply Chain Resilience: Improving visibility, agility, and the ability to respond effectively to disruptions is a critical priority. 6

## Emerging Technologies Gaining Traction

Beyond the core areas, certain emerging technologies are also capturing attention and investment:

- ● Immersive Reality (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality -  AR/VR): Being explored for experiential retail, virtual product try - ons, and enhancing customer engagement. 14
- ● Internet of Things (IoT): Applied for real -time supply chain visibility, developing smart products, and optimizing in - store operations. 11
- ● Blockchain: Considered for enhancing traceability and transparency in supply chains, particularly for food safety and ethical sourcing. 32

## Regional IT Spending Growth

Forrester provides a global perspective on IT spending growth in 2024, forecasting a 5.3% increase to reach $4.7 trillion. 19 Regional variations are significant:

- ● Asia Pacific (APAC): Expected to lead global growth at 5.7%. India is a notable driver, with domestic and government tech spend projected to grow by 9.5%.

China's digital economy already accounts for 41.5% of its GDP. However, there are disparities, as seen in J apan where many SMEs lag in digitalization. 19  This rapid growth in APAC, particularly in markets like India, juxtaposed with lagging digitalization in other areas such as J apanese SMEs, signals a complex regional landscape. Tech vendors cannot adopt a uniform strategy for APAC. Instead, a segmented approach is necessary, tailoring offerings from foundational digital transformation support for less mature segments to advanced AI solutions for more developed markets. Partnering with local entities may also be crucial to address specific market needs and nuances effectively. 38

- ● North America: Projected to grow by 5.4%. The financial services and healthcare sectors are anticipated to lead tech spending. Software and IT services are expected to capture 60% of US tech spend by 2027. 19
- ● EMEA (Europe):  Forecasted to grow by 5.1%. The region needs to accelerate its tech spend to meet established 2030 digital targets, such as achieving 75% cloud adoption among businesses. 19

## 3. Buyer Mindset by Role

Understanding the diverse array of individuals involved in B2B technology buying decisions within Consumer Goods (CG) companies is crucial. Their unique priorities, pain points, and the influence of evolving workplace demographics profoundly shape their te chnology adoption mindset.

## Identifying Key Technology Decision - Makers and Influencers

The technology buying process in CG firms typically involves a committee of stakeholders, each bringing a distinct perspective:

- ● IT Decision - Makers (ITDMs): CIOs and IT leaders have traditionally focused on ensuring robust infrastructure, maintaining security, managing system integration, and optimizing costs. 40 Their role is evolving from a purely operational one to that of a strategic business partner. 40 Forrester's research indicates that IT departments possess considerable autonomy in decision - making but are often constrained by external factors like compliance requirements, resource allocation challenges, and interdepartmental dependencies. 41
- ● Line of Business (LOB) Leaders: Executives in Marketing (CMO), Sales, Supply Chain (CSCO), and Operations are increasingly influential in technology selection. Their primary focus is on solutions that directly drive their specific business outcomes, such as revenue growth, increased mar ket share, operational efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction. 40 Gartner emphasizes that CIOs must articulate the value of IT investments in terms that resonate with LOB priorities, namely revenue generation, cost optimization, and risk mitigation. 40
- ● Data and Analytics Leaders: Chief Data Officers (CDOs), Heads of Analytics, and similar roles are pivotal in decisions concerning data platforms, business intelligence (BI) tools, and AI/ML solutions. Forrester's findings highlight that CPG data leaders are particularly focused on m inimizing data redundancies and effectively leveraging external data sources to compensate for limited first - party data access. 24
- ● Sustainability/ESG Officers: Chief Sustainability Officers (CSOs) and ESG leaders have emerged as significant influencers and, increasingly, buyers of technology. This is a direct consequence of escalating regulatory pressure and heightened consumer demand for sustainable and ethical practices. 9 Their

technology priorities center on solutions for ESG data management, transparent reporting, carbon tracking, and ensuring ethical sourcing. The growing importance of this role means technology vendors must now cater to a new set of buyer personas with specific, often non-negotiable, requirements related to sustainability data and compliance.

- ● Finance Leaders: Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and finance departments play a critical role in approving significant technology investments. Their evaluation criteria heavily emphasize Return on Investment (ROI), potential cost savings, and the mitigation of financial r isks associated with technology adoption. 40
- ● Executive Leadership (CEO, COO): The C-suite provides final approval for major strategic technology initiatives, especially those tied to overarching business transformation efforts, achieving competitive differentiation, and securing long -term growth. 12

## Priorities and Pain Points by Role

Each buyer role approaches technology decisions with distinct priorities and pain points:

- ● ITDMs: Prioritize system reliability, robust data security, seamless integration with existing enterprise systems, scalability to meet future demands, dependable vendor support, and a favorable Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Key pain points include managing lega cy systems, operating under budget constraints, addressing internal skills gaps, and the complexity of managing multiple vendors. 40
- ● CMOs/Marketing Leaders: Focus on customer acquisition and retention, building strong brand equity, delivering personalized customer experiences (CX), maximizing campaign effectiveness, and proving marketing ROI. Common pain points include demonstrating the tangible value of mark eting initiatives, optimizing Martech ROI, and orchestrating complex customer journeys across multiple touchpoints. 5
- ● Sales Leaders:  Primarily concerned with driving revenue growth, enhancing sales team productivity, managing the sales pipeline effectively, and fostering strong customer relationships. Challenges include long B2B sales cycles, buyer indecision, and ensuring alignment be tween sales and marketing efforts. 44
- ● Supply Chain Leaders (CSCOs): Strive for cost reduction, operational efficiency, supply chain resilience, end - to - end visibility, on - time delivery, and optimized inventory levels. Major pain points stem from frequent disruptions, demand volatility, and a lack of comprehensive visibilit y across the supply

network. 26

- ● ESG Leaders:  Prioritize meeting stringent compliance requirements, achieving ambitious sustainability targets, ensuring transparent and auditable reporting, and promoting ethical sourcing practices throughout the value chain. Key challenges include the collection and quality assurance of diverse ESG data, integrating ESG considerations into core business strategy, and balancing sustainability goals with overall growth objectives. 31

## Influence of Generational Cohorts

The demographic makeup of the workforce is also influencing B2B buying behavior:

- ● Millennials as IT Buyers and Business Decision - Makers:  IDC research underscores that millennials now play a "large and active role" in organizational technology procurement. They are characterized as "thinking differently" from both older (Gen X, Boomers) and younger (Gen Z) colleagues. Crucially, millennials are "open to new technologies without carrying too much negative brand-awareness baggage," positioning them as a "sweet spot" for technology companies. 46  This suggests a greater receptivity to innovative solutions and a preference for digital - first engagement models.
- ● Gen Z in the Workforce: As Gen Z enters more influential roles, their inherent preferences for digital experiences, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility will increasingly shape B2B buying criteria. 5 McKinsey has noted the "Gen Z effect" on customer care, indicating that their expectations are already influencing service design and delivery. 17

The convergence of these generational influences, particularly the rise of digitally native Millennial buyers 46 , with the broader "B2B Consumerism" trend (discussed below), creates a powerful dynamic. B2B buyers in the CG sector increasingly expect seamless, intuitive, and personalized technology experiences, moving beyond purely functional tools. This places consi derable pressure on technology vendors to significantly upgrade their user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and overall customer service to mirror the sophistication of consumer applications.

## The "B2B Consumerism" Effect

A significant shift in buyer expectations is captured by Accenture's concept of "B2B consumerism." This refers to B2B buyers increasingly expecting the same frictionless, personalized, and digitally -enabled experiences in their professional procurement pro cesses that they encounter as B2C consumers.47 Key statistics supporting this trend include:

- ● 94% of B2B buyers compare goods online before making purchasing decisions.
- ● 86% prefer using self -service tools for reordering rather than interacting with a salesperson.
- ● 98% expect a consistent purchasing experience across all channels.
- ● 84% are willing to pay more for great branded experiences.
- ● 71% will seek out a competitor if finding a product or solution is inconvenient. 47 Forrester's finding that 81% of B2B buyers express dissatisfaction with the winning provider in a recent B2B purchase highlights a significant gap in meeting these evolved expectations. 45

A particular challenge for CG companies is the "data disconnect." While LOB leaders (especially in marketing and sales) and data leaders are eager to harness data and AI for enhanced customer understanding and personalization 5 , they are often constrained by limited access to first - party data and the prevalence of internal data silos. 24 This creates a specific pain point that technology solutions focusing on data integration, data enrichment, and secure data collaboration (such as Customer Data Platforms, data clean rooms, and AI -driven analytics capable of unifying disparate data source s) can effectively address.

The following table outlines the priorities, pain points, and preferences of key B2B technology buyer roles within the Consumer Goods sector:

## 4. Messaging and Content Preferences

Effective communication with Consumer Goods (CG) technology buyers requires carefully crafted messaging and content tailored to their specific roles, pain points, and stage in the buying journey. As buyers become more independent and discerning, the qualit y and relevance of information provided by technology vendors are paramount.

## Effective Messaging Themes

Several core messaging themes resonate strongly with CG technology buyers:

- ● ROI and Business Value: Demonstrating a clear and quantifiable return on investment is critical. This includes showcasing financial benefits, operational cost savings, and contributions to profitable growth. 34 CIOs, in particular, need technology factors translated into tangible business outcomes they can communicate to other executives. 40
- ● Efficiency and Productivity Gains: Highlighting how technology can streamline complex operations, automate manual or repetitive tasks, and improve overall

workforce productivity is a powerful motivator. 11

- ● Innovation and Competitive Advantage: Messaging should articulate how a technology solution enables product innovation, facilitates market differentiation, and helps future -proof the business against evolving market dynamics and competitive pressures. 1
- ● Risk Mitigation and Compliance: Addressing concerns around data security, navigating the complex web of regulatory compliance (especially for ESG, product safety, and data privacy), and enhancing supply chain resilience are key selling points. 9 Content that explicitly details how a technology solution mitigates these specific risks -such as ensuring ESG compliance or improving supply chain traceability to prevent recalls -will resonate strongly, particularly with non - IT stakeholders like legal, fi nance, and sustainability teams. The considerable cost of non-compliance or a major supply chain failure in the CG sector means buyers in risk- management-focused roles are actively seeking solutions that reduce these vulnerabilities.
- ● Enhanced Customer Experience (CX): Focusing on the ability to deliver superior personalization, create seamless omnichannel engagement, and meet (or exceed) evolving consumer expectations is crucial in the consumer - centric CG industry. 5
- ● Sustainability and Ethical Operations: Aligning with the growing strategic importance of ESG goals and responsible business practices within CG companies is essential. Messaging should clearly demonstrate how technology enables the achievement of these objectives and enhances brand reputation among conscious consumers. 9
- ● Data - Driven Insights and Decision - Making:  Emphasizing the capability to unlock the true value of data for improved forecasting accuracy, deeper consumer personalization, and more informed strategic planning is highly attractive. 6
- ● Simplicity and Ease of Integration/Use: Addressing the "B2B consumerism" trend, messages that highlight intuitive user interfaces, ease of deployment, and seamless integration with existing technology stacks will be well - received. 47 The increasing buyer skepticism, with only 9% finding vendor websites reliable 45 , means that content demonstrating value (e.g., interactive demos, ROI calculators, detailed case studies with quantifiable results, pilot programs) will be far more effective than content that merely claims value. Buyers seek tangible proof and direct exp erience.

Preferred Content Formats Across the Buyer Journey

B2B content marketing best practices, adaptable to the CG sector, suggest varying content formats for different stages of the buyer journey:

- ● Awareness/Top of Funnel (TOFU): The goal is to attract new audiences and educate them on problems or opportunities. Effective formats include search -optimized blog posts, insightful infographics, engaging social media content, and thought leadership articles. 50 Early-stage content is often left ungated to encourage engagement. 51
- ● Consideration/Middle of Funnel (MOFU): The objective is to qualify leads, showcase how the vendor's solutions address specific problems, and build trust and credibility. Common formats include detailed white papers, compelling case studies (Salesforce highlights the effectiveness of case studi es that show step by-step solutions to real problems 50 ), vendor comparison guides, interactive webinars, practical checklists, and useful templates. 50 Gated content is often employed at this stage to capture lead information. 51
- ● Decision/Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): The aim is to convert qualified leads into customers. Content formats include personalized product demonstrations, free trials or sandbox environments, detailed vendor comparisons, ROI calculators, implementation guides, and strong customer testimonials. 14
- ● Post - Purchase/Loyalty: Focus is on ensuring customer success, fostering loyalty, and encouraging advocacy. Useful content includes comprehensive tutorials, extensive knowledge bases, active user communities, best practice guides, and timely new feature announcements. 52

The increasing complexity of the buying journey and the involvement of multiple, often time -constrained stakeholders 45 also point to a growing need for easily digestible "micro -content." Short video explainers, executive summaries of longer reports, key -takeaway infographics, and concise social media snippets can be quickly consumed and shared within the buying committee, acting as gateways to more detailed information.

## Tailoring Content and Regional Nuances

Content must be tailored to the specific roles, responsibilities, and pain points of different buyer personas within the CG company (e.g., IT, Marketing, Supply Chain, ESG). 22 A CFO will prioritize content detailing ROI and TCO, while a CSO will seek information on compliance capabilities and sustainability impact.

Regional nuances in content consumption and messaging are critical for global

## success:

- ● Language and Cultural Localization: This goes beyond simple translation to include adaptation of imagery, tone of voice, humor, and cultural references. Professional translation by native speakers is essential. 53 Direct marketing approaches that are effective in some regions (e.g., the US) might be perceived as too aggressive in others. 53
- ● Channel Preferences: While LinkedIn is a dominant B2B platform in North America and Europe, messaging apps like WeChat (China) or WhatsApp (parts of Europe and Latin America) play a more significant role in business communication in some regions. 53
- ● Communication Styles: Cultural preferences vary; some expect formal, detailed documentation, while others appreciate brevity and a more conversational tone. 53

## ● Specific Regional Considerations:

- ○ APAC: Buyers often consult third - party sources like peers and industry analysts before directly engaging with vendors. 54 Content such as localized analyst reports, peer reviews, and regional case studies can be highly influential. Given the predominantly channel - led GTM in APAC, content must also be designed to enable partners effectively. 39
- ○ EMEA: This region sees a high percentage of purchase stalls. 54 Content that proactively addresses common objections, provides clear implementation roadmaps, and builds trust is crucial. Messaging that focuses on enabling digital business transformation often resonates well. 54
- ○ North America: The focus is often on improving customer experience. 54 Direct GTM models are common  39 , and content highlighting innovation, competitive differentiation, and clear business outcomes is valuable.

The following table offers a guide to aligning content formats with the buyer journey stages for CG technology buyers:

## 5. Buying Journey &amp; Channel Behavior

The B2B technology buying process within the Consumer Goods (CG) sector is a multifaceted journey, characterized by its non - linear progression, the involvement of diverse stakeholders, and significant regional variations in channel preferences and go-to-market (GTM) patterns. Understanding these dynamics is essential for technology vendors aiming to effectively engage and convert CG buyers.

## Mapping the B2B Technology Buying Journey

The traditional linear sales funnel model is increasingly inadequate to describe modern B2B buying. Instead, the journey is complex and iterative, with buyers often revisiting stages and gathering information from a multitude of sources concurrently. 45 Deloitte's research on consumer decision - making highlights this shift, emphasizing that buyers move back and forth between stages, a principle that extends to B2B contexts. 52 McKinsey's Consumer Decision Journey (CDJ) framework also underscores this non -linearity. 55

Adapted for B2B technology procurement in the CG sector, key stages include:

- 1. Problem/Need Identification &amp; Initial Consideration: The journey often begins with the recognition of a business challenge (e.g., inefficiencies in the supply chain, the need for deeper consumer insights, mounting pressure for ESG compliance) or a strategic opportunity. This triggers an initial exploration of potential solution categories and, sometimes, early identification of known vendors. 55
- 2. Research &amp; Discovery / Active Evaluation: This phase is characterized by extensive independent research. B2B buyers are reportedly 69% of the way through their journey before they engage with a sales representative. 45 They actively compare offerings online (94% of B2B buyers engage in this 47 ), scrutinize vendor websites (97% of buyers do so 45 ), and consult a wide array of third - party sources. During this stage, their "consideration sets" of potential solutions and vendors can expand or contract as they gather more information. 52
- 3. Requirements Definition &amp; Shortlisting: Buyers tend to establish their purchase requirements before  making direct contact with sellers (85% of buyers

follow this pattern 45 ). Notably, vendor shortlists are becoming more concise, with 49% of buyers considering only one to three products for evaluation. 45

- 4. Vendor Engagement &amp; Evaluation: Once a shortlist is formed, buyers engage directly with selected vendors. This typically involves product demonstrations, requests for proposals (RFPs), and potentially proof - of - concept (PoC) projects. The focus is on assessing solution fit, vendor credib ility, and the potential for a strong partnership.
- 5. Consensus Building &amp; Internal Justification: This is often a lengthy and complex phase, involving navigating internal buying committees composed of diverse stakeholders (IT, LOB, ESG, Finance, etc.). Securing budget approval and building a compelling internal business case for the investment are cri tical. The typical B2B buying cycle can span 11.5 months, with multinational purchases averaging 16 months. 45  This stage is particularly prone to stalls.
- 6. Decision &amp; Purchase: This involves the final selection of a vendor and solution, followed by contract negotiation and procurement.
- 7. Implementation &amp; Adoption: Post-purchase, the focus shifts to deploying the technology effectively and ensuring widespread user adoption within the organization to realize the anticipated benefits.
- 8. Post - Purchase Evaluation &amp; Advocacy: Buyers assess the realized value of the technology, the quality of ongoing vendor support, and the potential for future engagement (e.g., upgrades, additional services). A significant 81% of B2B buyers express dissatisfaction with their chosen provider po st-purchase, indicating considerable challenges in this phase and opportunities for vendors who excel in post-sale support and value delivery. 45

## Channel Preferences

CG technology buyers utilize a variety of channels for information gathering and vendor engagement:

- ● Digital Channels: Vendor websites are a primary touchpoint, although buyer trust in them is relatively low (only 9% of buyers consider vendor websites reliable sources  45 ). Search engines, industry -specific online publications, webinars, virtual events, and professional social media platforms (particularly LinkedIn for B2B networking and content consumption) are also heavily used.
- ● Third - Party Validation: Given the low trust in direct vendor claims, third - party validation becomes exceptionally important.
- ○ Industry Analysts: Reports and evaluations from firms like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC are crucial for market understanding, technology

assessment, and vendor shortlisting, especially in regions like APAC where buyers rely heavily on such sources before vendor engagement. 54

- ○ Peer Networks &amp; Reviews: Buyers actively consult with peers and existing customers of potential solutions. 54 Online review platforms are also consulted, though there is some skepticism regarding the authenticity of reviews (73% of buyers believe they encounter fake reviews 45 ).
- ○ Case Studies and Testimonials: These are important for establishing credibility and demonstrating real - world success. 50
- ● Industry Events &amp; Conferences: These provide valuable opportunities for learning about new technologies, networking with peers and experts, and discovering potential vendors. 51
- ● Sales Interactions: While buyers conduct significant independent research, sales interactions remain vital. Buyers initiate the first contact with sellers 81% of the time. 45 These interactions must be highly value -driven, helping buyers to identify hidden challenges, uncover missed opportunities, or gain new perspectives on their problems. 45

## Self-Service and Engagement Models

- ● Preference for Self - Service:  There is a strong preference for self - service options, with 86% of B2B buyers preferring self - service tools for reordering. 47 This preference extends to information gathering and initial problem - solving, where buyers want to find answers and explore solutions independently before engaging with sales.
- ● Direct vs. Indirect Engagement (Channel Partners): The dominant engagement model varies significantly by region:
- ○ North America: Primarily characterized by direct sales models (approximately 90%), facilitated by the relative homogeneity of the market.

39

- ○ EMEA &amp; APAC: Predominantly channel -led (less than 30% direct sales in EMEA, and less than 20% in APAC). This is due to the diversity in cultures, languages, regulatory environments, and business practices across these vast regions. 39 Channel partners (resellers, distributors, SIs) are essential for local market access, building relationships, and navigating regional complexities. 38 This necessity for different GTM approaches implies that successful global tech vendors must develop entirely distinct marketing strategies, sales enablement programs, support structures, and even product localization efforts for these regions, rather tha n merely adapting a UScentric model.

## Regional Differences in Buying Journey and GTM

## ● North America:

- ○ Business Driver Focus: A key driver for technology purchases is the goal of improving customer experience. 54
- ○ GTM Model:  Primarily direct sales engagement. 39
- ○ Interaction Style: Buyers engage in significant independent research but may be more inclined towards direct vendor interaction earlier compared to other regions.

## ● EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa):

- ○ Business Driver Focus: A strong emphasis on technology investments that support the shift to digital business models. 54
- ○ Purchase Stalls: Exhibits the highest percentage of purchase stalls globally. 54 Understanding and addressing the root causes of these stalls (e.g., complexity, lack of internal consensus, budget issues, unclear ROI) is critical. Vendors who can proactively provide resources to help buyers navigate these internal hurdles are more like ly to reactivate stalled deals.
- ○ GTM Model:  Significantly channel -led, particularly due to the diverse nature of its sub - regions. 39
- ○ Communication: Communication style preferences and preferred channels can vary widely within the diverse EMEA region. 53

## ● APAC (Asia -Pacific):

- ○ Early Interactions: Buyers in APAC show a strong tendency to consult third -party sources -such as peers, existing customers, and industry analysts -to understand the market and evaluate vendor options before  engaging directly with providers. 10
- ○ GTM Model:  Predominantly channel -led, with some experiences suggesting an almost exclusively indirect model. 39 This necessitates robust partner enablement programs.
- ○ Communication Challenges: Direct engagement with end -users can be challenging due to language barriers and cultural differences in communication styles (e.g., silence in meetings, lack of direct feedback during demos). 39  Standard natural language processing tools may also struggle with diverse accents.
- ○ Channel Management: BCG emphasizes the importance of adopting a segmented GTM approach and effectively managing channel partners as key strategies for success in emerging economies within the APAC region. 38

## 6. Strategic Insights for Marketers

To effectively target and engage B2B technology buyers in the Consumer Goods (CG) sector, marketers must adopt nuanced strategies that acknowledge the industry's unique challenges, evolving buyer expectations, and significant regional variations. The following insights provide a framework for developing impactful go - to- market (GTM) approaches, enabling sales teams, leveraging data and AI, building trust, and adapting to global market dynamics.

## Key Considerations for Go - to - Market (GTM) Strategies

- ● Embrace "B2B Consumerism": The expectation for B2C -like experiences in B2B transactions is no longer a niche trend but a baseline requirement. Marketers must ensure all touchpoints -from website navigation and content consumption to product demos and support interactions -are designed with a focus on ease of use, personalization, and self -service capabilities. 47 This means intuitive interfaces, readily available information, and channels that empower buyers to find answers independently.
- ● Segment by Digital Maturity and Specific Needs: The CG industry is not monolithic in its adoption of technology. Some companies are still focused on foundational digital transformation (e.g., establishing basic e - commerce capabilities, consolidating disparate data sources), while others are exploring

advanced applications of AI for hyper - personalization or predictive analytics for supply chain optimization. 19  Marketing messages and solution offerings must be tailored to this spectrum of digital maturity.

- ● Address the ESG Imperative Strategically: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations have moved to the forefront of C - suite agendas in the CG sector. Technology solutions should be positioned not merely as tools for compliance but as strategic enablers of sustainability goals, enhancing brand reputation and meeting consumer demand for ethical practices. 9 Marketers should highlight how their technology helps CG companies achieve tangible ESG outcomes, such as reducing carbon footprint, ensuring ethical sourcing through transparent supply chains, or minimizing waste. This transforms the conversation from a cost of compliance to an investment in brand value and long-term resilience.
- ● Focus on Demonstrable ROI and Business Outcomes: CG companies, particularly in the current economic climate, are highly focused on investments that deliver measurable results. Marketing collateral and sales conversations must clearly articulate how technology solutions translate into tangible benefits such as profitable volume growth, operational cost reductions, effective risk mitigation, and improved customer experience metrics. 1
- ● Build an Ecosystem Approach: No single vendor can address all the complex needs of a CG company. Fostering strategic partnerships is crucial, especially for data collaboration (given CPGs' often limited access to first - party data 24 ) and for achieving effective channel reach and local expertise in diverse regions like EMEA and APAC. 38

## Recommendations for Sales Enablement and Engagement

- ● Equip Sales to Evolve into Trusted Advisors: B2B buyers in the CG sector are conducting extensive independent research. 45 However, they may still misdiagnose their core problems or overlook critical opportunities. Sales teams must be enabled with deep industry knowledge and consultative selling skills to ask insightful questions, offer novel perspectives, and guide buyers to ward the optimal solution, even if it challenges the buyer's initial assumptions. This approach builds credibility and positions the vendor as a strategic partner rather than just a product pusher. 45
- ● Navigate Complex Buying Committees: Technology decisions in CG firms typically involve multiple stakeholders from IT, various lines of business (marketing, supply chain), ESG departments, and finance. Sales teams need

training and tools to identify these key players, understand their distinct priorities and pain points, and tailor their engagement strategies accordingly. 45

- ● Provide Tools to Overcome Purchase Stalls: With a high percentage of B2B purchases stalling 45 , sales enablement should include resources designed to help buyers overcome internal hurdles. This could include ROI justification templates, stakeholder alignment guides, risk assessment frameworks, and clear implementation roadmaps that de - risk the deci sion.
- ● Focus on Value Beyond the Initial Sale: Given the high rate of buyer dissatisfaction post - purchase  45 , emphasizing a long-term partnership, robust ongoing support, and a commitment to helping clients achieve sustained success is vital for retention and advocacy.

## Leveraging Data and AI to Enhance Marketing Effectiveness

- ● Personalize at Scale: Utilize data analytics and AI to gain a deeper understanding of buyer behavior, segment audiences with greater precision, and deliver personalized content and experiences across all relevant channels. 5
- ● Optimize the Martech Stack: Ensure that the marketing technology stack is not only comprehensive but also effectively utilized and integrated. Gartner reports that a significant portion of available Martech capabilities (58%) goes unused by marketers. 43
- ● Decode Buying Signals: Implement systems to connect and interpret buying signals across various channels (website visits, content downloads, event attendance, social media interactions) to craft meaningful and contextual experiences that resonate with buyers at each stage of th eir journey. 48
- ● Employ AI for Content and Insights: B2B marketers are reportedly lagging behind buyers in the adoption of GenAI. 48 There is a significant opportunity to use AI for tasks such as repurposing existing content into various formats, creating derivative assets, and surfacing valuable buyer and customer insights from feedback, interviews, and call transcripts. 48 The significant gap between the general acknowledgment of AI's potential by business leaders 15 and the CPG industry's specific prioritization and planning for AI 3 underscores this point. Marketers must focus on highly specific, quantifiable, and de - risked AI use cases tailored to the CG sector, such as GenAI for accelerating new product development timelines 21 or improving demand forecast accuracy 28 , rather than promoting broad AI capabilities. Pilot programs and clear ROI frameworks will be essential to bridge this adoption gap.

- ● Transparency is Key: In an environment of buyer skepticism, transparency regarding product capabilities, pricing models, data usage policies (especially concerning AI-driven solutions), and potential limitations is crucial for building trust.
- ● Consistency in Messaging and Brand Stance: CG buyers value consistency. Brands that frequently reverse their stance on important social or political issues risk eroding trust, which can lead to boycotts. 57
- ● Prioritize Reliability and Quality: These are fundamental drivers of an exceptional B2B buyer experience and are critical for establishing long - term relationships. 49
- ● Invest in Post - Purchase Success: A seamless implementation process, robust and responsive support, and a proactive approach to ensuring customers realize continuous value from the technology are paramount for fostering loyalty and turning customers into advocates. 52

## Adapting to Regional Specifics for Global Success

- ● North America: Marketing and sales efforts should align with the regional focus on improving customer experience. Direct engagement models are prevalent, and messaging that highlights innovation and competitive differentiation is typically well-received. 39
- ● EMEA: Marketers should prepare for potentially longer sales cycles and a higher likelihood of purchase stalls. Messaging should emphasize the benefits of digital transformation. Strong channel partnerships are essential for navigating the diverse sub-markets within EMEA. 39
- ● APAC: A channel-centric GTM strategy is paramount, requiring significant investment in partner enablement. Leveraging third - party validation through industry analysts and localized case studies is highly effective. Marketers must be prepared for nuanced communi cation styles and prioritize building strong local relationships, often through partners. 38

By internalizing these strategic insights, B2B technology marketers can more effectively navigate the complexities of the Consumer Goods sector, build stronger relationships with buyers, and ultimately drive sustainable growth. The emphasis must be on providing demonstrable value, fostering trust through transparency and expertise, and adapting flexibly to a dynamic global marketplace.
