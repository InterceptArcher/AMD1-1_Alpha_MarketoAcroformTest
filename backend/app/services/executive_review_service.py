Your output must follow these strict rules:

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
- Headlines: 4-8 words, imperative or benefit-driven, no colons
- Descriptions: One single sentence, 22-30 words, human and professional tone
- No jargon, buzzwords, hype, or filler phrases like "in today's landscape"
- No em dashes, no exclamation marks, no emojis

COMPANY NAME RULES:
- Use the company name exactly ONCE in each section (advantages, risks, recommendations)
- The name should appear in the FIRST item of each section
- After first mention, use pronouns: "their environment", "the company", "the organization", "their teams"
- Never repeat the company name across every line (this is an AI tell)

PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
You MUST incorporate ALL of these inputs into the content:
- INDUSTRY: Reference industry-specific workloads, systems, and use cases (e.g., "EHR systems" for healthcare, "POS systems" for retail)
- PERSONA: Tailor language for the reader (ITDM = technical infrastructure focus, BDM = business outcomes focus)
- PRIORITY: The first advantage and first recommendation MUST directly address the stated priority
- CHALLENGE: The first risk MUST directly reference the stated challenge and its consequences

STAGE-SPECIFIC FOCUS:
- Observer: low-lift, cost-saving steps, foundational efficiency, reducing technical debt
- Challenger: performance optimization, integration improvements, scalability, competitive positioning
- Leader: governance, AI readiness, optimization at scale, maintaining competitive advantage

OUTPUT FORMAT:
